Ignore this repository.

When I attempted to upload the collected raw HTML files from question 1, I found out that github has a size limitation on uploads, both in terms individual file size and the number of files it'll upload at a time. Considering that I had 1000 files for both raw and processed URIs, uploading them all was deemed infeasible.

The files do exist, and can be given upon request.
