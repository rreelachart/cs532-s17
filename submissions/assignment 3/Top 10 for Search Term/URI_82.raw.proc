   The gang tries out a new random movie selection device, to disastrous
   results. What movies are selected? Watch and see but here’s a hint:
   they’re all the worst possible selections.

       The space between the pegs on their plinketto board is too wide,
       which is causing the puck to almost always go down in a straight
       line from where it’s dropped as opposed to it being random.

       Well, 8 comments in, time to go off topic.
       So I just saw the XMen: Apocalypse trailer for the first time. Is
       J-Law pregnant or something? She looks so fucking bloated. I
       thought they cast Boss Nass in her role. Or the re-animated corpse
       of Robert Z’Dar.

       Prince joke! Too soon? Not really, they probably recorded it before

       It’s funny, on Pre-Rec Rich is such a baller with dank ass moves.
       On Best of the Worst at times he’s basicly reduced to a worn out
       chew toy for Mike to fuck with.

       Whimsical Rape Riot sounds like a band name.
     * Wizard Phoenix
       Their hit song would be Midgets and Butts and Boobs.
     * The Wicker Man (BWF)
       Jack is acting all embarrassed about the video games when Mike asks
       him what color Ken and Ryu are. Who plays video games for that long
       and doesn’t know that?
       These other frauds, Rich and Jack, know jack shit about Double
       Dragon. Maybe if Double Dragon were about to two stepbrothers from
       a home ruined by a drunken white father walking around a beach
       reading their father’s journal and learning to accept stuff would
       be up their alley instead?
     * The Wicker Man (BWF)
       Someone should make a band called “x should be a band name”!
     * Bubs
       Well I think it’s been well-established in RLM canon that Jack and
       Rich know about as much about video games as I know about quantum
       physics. Which is to say: jack shit.

       Plinketto is clearly an advanced mechanical computer designed to

       well if you want a genuine answer:
       “crapcore”-crapcore is pretty much extremely brutal crap, they
       mainly consist of overdriven drum loops, samples from computer
       games, low frequency feedback noise, the lyrics are mostly only
       swears, distorted screams or short idiotic phrases
     * Wizard Phoenix

       Also, they seem to cure everything by cutting off your arms and
       legs, burning you severely and putting you into what looks like a

       This episode was kind of a clusterfuck. No interesting discussions.
       Granted, the new torture device is amazing. And the Shaq meat….
       Mmmmmm…. But it felt kind of rushed and unfinished. It seems the
       guys were really struggling to get it recorded.

       Is that a chewing tobacco tin they are dropping down the board?
     * AreyouaNazi? Isthatyourelf?
       I think you’re thinking of Kull the Conqueror, with Kevin Sorbo. It
       was because Arnie didn’t come back for Conan 3, so the producer
       pushed for another movie anyway.

       I don’t know, it felt unstructured, more fourth wall than episode.
       It was like a whole lot of outtakes instead of a legitimate

       funnier than the “real” episode but something about this one rubbed

       Pretty much a consistent dynamic of Rich being ragged on by Mike;
       Jack throwing everything he’s got at the wall; Josh being that
       ancillary character that we all love; and Mike’s just a douche
     * LameSame
       I know what you mean, but something came off as particularly
       mean-spirited in this one. And I disagree about Josh. I really am
       not a Wizard fan. I think he’s a bit of a prick. Mike, on the other
       hand, I often find is doing things in good fun – even the “douchey”
       things (even though he should have laid off Rich a bit). But yeah,
       I just didn’t feel like I was with happy company in this one.
       Something was especially rancid in this one for me.
     * Sully
       Once you start making rape and cannibalism jokes, everyone’s gotta
       be on board or things just get weird. Wizard seemed a bit put off
       by the darker humor and essentially killed the vibe, which was made
       all the worse when the rest of the guys kept chasing the punchline
       without him.
       What’s interesting is, Jack used to be the moral anchor of the
       group, but even back then he was at least funny in his reactions to
       what was happening around him.

       But where was the workplace massacre? In the UK (and elsewhere?)
       they say ‘going mental’ whereas in the US, we say, ‘going postal’:
       [144]https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Going_postal
       “The expression derives from a series of incidents from 1986 onward
       in which United States Postal Service (USPS) workers shot and
       killed managers, fellow workers, and members of the police or
       general public in acts of mass murder.”
     * Oppai
       I laughed my ass off though.
     * Captain Prickhard
       Jack felt the need to voice his disapproval of rape.
     * Neil Young
       I’m with Josh on this one – I thought Rich and Mike were being
       dicks and the level of drunken silliness was high. Not sure Mike
       and Rich should be together without Jay to mediate.

       That Plinketto board insufficiently randomizes the choice. For
       example if you drop the puck near the ends, there is over a 50 %
       chance it lands one of the 4 movies at the end and only a 2% chance
       for the puck to land on the opposite side.
       You’d need a board with 80 or more layers to get reasonable
       randomization.

       I gotta feeling they are misjudging Double Dragon.
       It’s clearly a 1990’s Ninja Turtles kinda movie, aimed at little
       kids.
       Hence, Alyssa Milano’s gang of little kids.
       Hence, no guns. Cause we don’t want to market a kids movie in which
       kids get shot in the face.
       Hence… fart and burp jokes. Hence… the lack of swearing.
       Hence… they become friends with the mutant in the end.
       It’s a little kids movie that got a too high a rating on account of
       being martial artsy.

       They didn’t even have the courtesy to end it with a still image and
       no credits, at least THAT would have been thematic. Shaq jokes

     * dollar store cashier wife
       empathise with this venomous cunt people! if you don’t 10 minutes
       of walking nude while nuns ring bells will lose all emotional
       impac…oh wait.
       But really Jamie’s subplot of season 5 and it’s aftermath here is
       downright hilarious.
     * tOmy`
       The whole thing had this odd vibe of “Fuck, we didn’t think this
       through, have we?”. But I blame the source / no source problem.
       I am also glad they ditched the source book and now are sourcing
       generic fairy tales for their big twists. Feels appropriate.

       The story is quickly jumping the [DEL: shark :DEL] dragon, but in a

       But needless to say, I am glad my hour of weekly misery is back. It
       was fun watching it, despite the fact that Cercei’s mother’s death
       was most likely not meant to be hysterical, and I still somewhat
       care about what is happening on screen.

       then she promptly loses the pet.
       I mean fuck, have you noticed that her whole storyline is basically
       about men doing her work for her? Men getting shit done? I don’t

       I’m hoping this is all mid-Plinkett SW:FA filming, and they just

       funny cameos, good camerawork, editing and use of set. It’s a

       This one kind of reminded me of that Wheel of the Worst where all
       three non-movie videos were terrible, so they didn’t have much
       comedic material to work with, so they resorted to just being mean
       to each other, in hopes to get some laughs. Can’t remember which
       WotW it was, but I thought it was much rogher to watch than this
       one. That’s the risk of going blind into one of those. It is
       possible all 3 videos are going to be not worthy.
       Keep in mind they filmed one that was so bad/devoid of laughs, they
       never finished editing it.
     * [231]Boss Ninja
       If Jay is around it works well with Josh because he engages him in
       the topic and everyone can be goofy. But, if it’s a Mike & Rich

     * WrongWithYourFace
       How about the Resident Evil episode? I got some of the best laughs
       out of that one to this day.
       I also like to show the Grown Ups 2 review. It’s short enough to
       keep the person’s interest (let’s face it, it’s hard to get someone
       to watch over a 5-minute youtube video, let alone 30 or 50). It
       also sets up RLM’s style of humor and shows the effort they put in
       their sets and effects.

       Yeah, Wizard’s pretty humorless. Jay doesn’t get overly goofy

       laugh at their antics without it being cringeworthy.
     * Amontillado
       It’s called the RLM bump
     * [234]Boss Ninja
       Yeah. I remember them saying that. It’s “””easy””” to fix though.
       Do less material and make it 25-35 minutes tops. Go with a
       different direction, discuss the business of b-movie garbage or
       talk about the director. Research things. It does not need to be
       funny just interesting.

       was blunt fun. Now he acts as a 10 year old asking Rich to say pee

     * [239]Boss Ninja

       I just don’t know about the TV budget. The one thing I didn’t like
       about Urban’s Dredd movie was how cheap it all looked. I mean, the
       Lawmasters were just regular bikes with some awkward body kit.
       Mega-City One looked just like Johannesburg with some megablocks
       added digitally. The cars were regular cars from our time.
       It should’ve been the other way around. Stallone’s Judge Dredd
       should’ve been the one with the micro budget, and Urban’s Dredd
       with the more expensive one.

     * Sully
       TV shows, comparably, can actually have larger budgets than movies
       because they’re reusing sets, costumes, and shots more often. The
       Walking Dead has a 2.75 mil-per episode budget. Over the last 6
       seasons, it has cost roughly 200mil to make. Dredd’s film budget
       was under 50mil.
       It can be done.
       The budget of Season 1 of DareDevil was about 15mil more than
       Dredd’s film budget.

       Banning religion is fundamentally a totalitarian idea. Criticism is

       married who are gay and for people who don’t want to minister a gay
       marriage. Both need protection. The power of the state must have
       limits. Gays can find a way to live satisfactory lives even if it’s
       not ideal and so should “evangelical crackpots” as they are usually
       called(I don’t like the term).
       I respect people who appose same sex marriage for many reasons. I
       do fear the fundamentalist christian mass because it’s usually a

       That’s easy. If gay marriage is against your religion, don’t get
       gay married. If it’s not, and you happen to be gay. Do you, boo. If
       you are gay, but gay marriage does go against you’re religion,
       you’re in the wrong religion and have bigger things to worry about.
       The more educated answer is this: Gay marriage, at least at some
       capacity, has existed in the Christian church up until around the
       late 18th century. It’s only recently that Christianity has become
       so sexually closed minded. Hell, priests and Popes could marry back
       in the day (around 40 previous popes were married).
       The thing is, the denial of gay marriage has nothing to do with
       religion and everything to do with assholes using religion to mask
       their own hate-fueled agendas. It’s nothing new. People have been
       doing it for forever, but it sucks.
       My view is this… you don’t pay taxes, you don’t get to push your
       views on the people who do. Religious institutions don’t pay taxes,

       No it’s a deeply rooted cultural and historical matter. Religion
       goes hand in hand with American history. It is also a very big
       thing to constitutionally change the terms for marriage even if it
       is for the better. It is a big deal. Even the most despised and
       religious ideal must in some form be protected if it’s not
       criminal. The bigotry and violence from the religious camps must of
       course stop. But a state must never be allowed to silence religious

       simultaneously pretending it’s at risk.
       Look, I get the back and forth. It’s an argument that has gone on

       Well Christianity is not a monolith so it has branched out to many
       forms. Your educated answer is unsatisfactory to me because it
       ignores the period between 100-300 BC that is where the evangelical
       focus lies at most. As for Christianity mixing with other cultures
       and becoming watered down the strongest red thread throughout
       protestant catholic and orthodox branches is that marriage is
       between man and woman. Your examples are oddities that have been
       injected and rejected. The times Christianity structured itself to
       an organisation rather than movement the marriage issue was
       ratified to look as we see as traditional through meetings and
       scriptural application. As for popes getting married I have not
       studied it. Christianity is so fascinating. I love reading about
       it.
       Religion must in many cases be protected from the state and I’m
       happy to support the non tax paying system we have now.

       That’s because it’s easy to win a debate when you’re in the right.
       Why would anyone want to deny service to someone just because they
       don’t agree with their life choices? I could understand a “Fuck
       you, you’re a child rapist. Get out of my store” situation, but why
       deny a gay couple a cake? Why deny a Muslim a job? It’s meaningless
       bigotry and not supported by any religious text, and it opens a
       whole can of worms that could potentially backfire on the Christian
       community and harm them just as much as anyone else.
       “I’m not going to hire you” or “I’m going to deny you that
       promotion because I can’t have someone who believes Jesus was the
       son of the lawd on my board.”
       “We’re a scientific organization, so no bible thumpers in the Space
       Program.”
       And then we’d have a “war on Christmas” debate on every 24hr news
       network every day of the fucking year.
       Why not a ‘Disagree but don’t Deny’ attitude?
     * [280]Boss Ninja
       Oh you are for a separation? I’ve been reading up on the issue. I
       find it necessary and I must admit I’ve never understood the term

       wearing disciple thing. I understand the U.S has a different
       history than Sweden but most Christians from America I talked to
       are kind of hippies and well that’s usually my kind of people that
       I connect with so they are mostly like a Swedish evangelical. Ehm…

       Christianity’s definition of marriage is that of “between a man and
       a woman”, but that’s Christianity’s definition, and unfortunately
       for Christianity, or Abrahamism in general, it didn’t invent
       marriage. Marriage began as a contract between tribes; a social
       union for the benefit of the people as a whole. It had nothing to
       do with children or families, it was about survival. A chief would
       give his daughter to another chief’s son and the two tribes would
       benefit from the union by sharing food, land, and warriors. There
       are many proven cases of sons being paired with sons. It didn’t
       matter. Everyone else who wasn’t of importance didn’t get
       “married.” They were pair bonded for their own purposes and no one
       really gave a shit.
       Money, war and disease fed the fear that fueled the push for
       couples to be reproductive only, and this later bled into religion.
       “Gotta keep the family name going.”
       “Gotta keep feeding the war machine bodies.”
       “Gotta replenish the purged population.” etc.
       Later on everyone wanted a ceremony to go with their pair bonding
       and so marriage became the norm. Even then though marriage wasn’t
       exclusively man and woman for, like, a while.

       Well as I replied. Christianity was brought forth by Christ and the
       theological base is found in mostly Paul’s writing. There you find
       many examples of how marriage works in form and purpose. The
       written custom as is the written word of God as they say is the
       basis for marriage in Judaism and Christianity.
       As you stated “the denial of gay marriage has nothing to do with
       religion and everything to do with assholes using religion to mask
       their own hate-fueled agendas.”
       It still has everything to do with religion. The history, the text.

       Guys, while this is indeed both the time and the place for a heated
       discussion about religion, I implore the both of you – lay down
       your no doubt sharp rhetorical weapons and rejoin instead the rest
       of us as we discuss whether Rich or Mike will be the first one to
       suffer a long overdue heart attack.
     * Sully
       It didn’t originally have anything to do with religion. It’s just
       another pagan thing that was adopted into the fold;
       speaking of Paul…
     * TheManHole
       Mike is easily the first to the grave he drinks way more then rich
       does.
     * TheManHole
       Really why not?
     * [303]Boss Ninja
       No they should not. Religion must be free from contributing
       financially. The richest camp always gets the loudest voice. That
       is governing religious thought. That is one very good way to
       actually protect democracy to keep it tax free and strictly a
       matter of public opinion..
       If a proposal is voiced (even religious) and it’s voted for that is
       functioning democracy. If a dissenting voice is totally opposite
       and it’s voted for that is functioning democracy. Don’t ad to it.
       Don’t take anything away. Don’t bully gays, don’t bully religion.
       Organize, campaign and vote.
     * Sully
       You’re crazy. Rich wasn’t even here.

       No. I don’t mind the sharp discussion. I just thought it lost focus

       rambling foxes are cute.

       The problem comes when billionaire religious groups are easily able
       to out-lobby those who actually want democracy instead of a
       theocracy, or more accurately, a plutocracy of wolves in shepherd
       clothing.

       It’s aimed at US audience. Which I am not.
       Sooo… the OMG effect it is trying to achieve by pointing out how
       much better the other side has it simply by implementing different
       policies, often created in USA, is lost on me.
       Then… There’s really nothing new in it for me.
       Apart from the Iceland bit, but that one has issues of its own.
       He even expands on the prison segment he already covered in Sicko,
       showing prisons in “Scandinavian utopia”.
       I.e. It’s a lot things we’ve seen him cover already.
       The rest… it’s all old news.
       Decriminalization of drugs, school systems and education in
       general, student debt, school food for kids, prisons, jail time for
       people running banks, strong unions creating better living
       conditions for workers and steady profit for companies…
       Meh… preaching to the quire from where I sit.
       BAD parts…
       He fucks up with education in Slovenia, painting it as some ideal
       “free college” European country.
       Cause it’s not really true.
       1 – it is FAR cheaper than in the US, but not free.
       2 – as it is a small country it has fewer universities and fewer
       openings. We’re talking 2 million citizens total and half a dozen
       universities.
       3 – it DOES have private universities and they are more expensive.
       Still, not as expensive as US ones.
       4 – according to ANY global ranking, Slovenian universities are
       couple a hundred places below US ones.
       5 – “free” higher education is something Slovenia inherited from
       Yugoslavia – a country which fell apart after Slovenia seceded from
       the federation of republics, starting a series of bloody
       decade-long wars in the rest of the former Yugoslavia.
       AND Slovenia left with money in the banks – most of it belonging to
       citizens in other Ex-Yu republics. It took 20 years of private
       lawsuits for them to start the work to pay it back.
       Slovenia is REALLY NOT a good role model for education OR how to
       run a country the size of USA.
       Too many “buts”. Starting with the whole federal units seceding
       from the union.
       He should have went with Sweden or something… but I guess he wanted
       to showcase a smaller country.
       Problem is a smaller country simply doesn’t work the same as a big
       one.
       Thus the second really bad part… Iceland as an example of how to
       deal with the financial crisis.
       Which is an island the size of ALMOST two Manhattans.
       With ~330 THOUSAND people living there.
       ~120 thousand of them living in the capitol, Reykjavik.
       Still… he tries to compare it to USA.
       Cause bankers went to jail there.
       Which he somehow, and I’m still not sure how, tries to explain by
       the fact that there are female bankers in Iceland and that Iceland
       had the first female president (elected – there were earlier cases
       elsewhere).
       Except Iceland, instead of bailing out its banks, simply decided to
       NOT PAY ITS DEBTS and to instead nationalize the banks.
       Brits and Dutch have a different view of the “Icelandic economic
       miracle”.
       Sure… they paid eventually. By finally, slowly, years later,
       liquidating the assets of bankrupt banks.
       Went swimmingly for Iceland as they avoided taking large loans to
       pay off outstanding debts – by not paying them when their clients
       came asking for their money.
       Oh… and by taking large loans from IMF and Norway, Sweden, Denmark,
       Finland…
       In effect, having someone else bail them out.
       But if you were a foreigner with your money in Iceland banks, maybe
       through a fund of some kind… well fuck you. Learn to do without for
       a while.
       But hey… something something men are aggressive, women are not –
       thus only one guy went to prison in USA and banks got bailed out.
       I don’t know why Moore went there with the documentary.
       He’s really shooting himself in the foot while undermining the very
       efforts and views he’s trying to support.

       Mike and Rich’s relationship does indeed come across as being
       heavily influenced by a rather incosistent reward/punishment model.
       Mike’s no doubt conscious inconsistent application of the model
       ensures that Rich is at constant unease whenever around Mike, thus
       solidifying Mike’s status as the alpha male of the group even
       further.
       We saw further evidence of Mike’s efforts to maintain alpha status
       when Jay started to bulk up and began to distinguish himself from
       the rest of the pack by being ‘the hot one’. Mike quickly asserted
       the potential threat of Jay’s sudden hotness and reacted to it
       promptly by subtly forcing upon Jay the feminine name of Susan (a
       name that has effectively managed to stick ever since even with
       examples of Jay referring to himself not once but several times as
       this feminine Susan character), thus effectively diminishing if not
       completely disarming the power Jay briefly wielded.

     * Captain Prickhard
       Cusack looks like an old drag queen in some shots.
     * cucadandi

       No consistent theme. Movies simply not as bad as others. No
       destruction. In-group bullying. Not enough rape…
     * OMNI
       No I like Wizard, but under pressure his wit fizzles out and then
       he gets frustrated (I have this problem sometimes) so I doesn’t
       look good on film and the tension was Palpatine thus ruining the
       comic vibe but I enjoy when the guys are fucking with each other
       whilst under the influence of alcohol, but a flaming puck would be
       awesome.

     * OMNI
       His sister is faring better, I think. I haven’t seen her in a while
     * Domo
       The reasons probably center around Rich and Josh getting fed up or
       being visibly annoyed by Mike’s behavior, no one to really steer
       the conversation either through someone like Jay or through
       editing, and the general “Going off the rails” feel of the episode.
       This one is definitely a weird episode, but it’s not bad.
       Everything just seems amplified. Rape jokes, cannibalism, poking
       fun at others is ramped up to 11 because Mike seems full on
       plastered both in front of the camera and in the editing room.
       In fact, I hate it so damn much I’m going to listen to it for a 3rd
       time!
     * Sheriff Mitchell
       Definitely not enough rape, I give you that.

       That’s all fair, but none of that stuff really matters to me as
       long as the episode makes me laugh, which it did.

       first time I felt like bad after watching anything from RLM.

       6 hours watching crap and then try to make material witch they
       deliver with quality. Other internet channels are just a waste of
       time but RLM has done stuff for more then 5 years now and still
       it’s really good.

       “Adrian Gottlieb is winning at life. He’s a successful video game
       designer with everything a man could ask for, including a warm
       comfy
       ride to Denver and a date for his sister’s wedding. But he finds
       himself
       in need of a total reboot when he’s left stranded at a snowy
       campground
       in Utah. Holiday plans? Epic fail.
       That is until Noah Walters offers him shelter for the night and a
       reluctant cross-country ride. Nothing about the ultraconservative
       geoarchaeologist should attract Adrian, but once he discovers
       Noah’s
       hidden love for video games, the two connect on a new level. Soon,
       a
       quiet but undeniable chemistry sparks.
       Something doesn’t add up, though. As the miles accumulate and time
       runs
       out, Noah must face the most difficult choice of his life.
       Meanwhile,
       Adrian must decide whether he’s ready to level up. Is their
       relationship
       status worth fighting for, or has this game ended before it’s even

       Newly minted MBA Tristan Jones doesn’t seem like the gaming type
       but he knows the business inside-out. Together, they’ll give an
       awesome presentation – they just have to survive the cross-country
       trip. Ravi’s opinion of Tristan is rebooted when he discovers a
       softer side to the conservative charmer and a new tension builds
       between them.
       Despite their best efforts to keep it casual, things heat up
       quickly.
       Tristan is hiding his true self for fear of what his parents might
       think. Ravi knows that feeling all too well, but he didn’t
       disconnect from his family years ago only to hide who he is now. To
       be together, Tristan has to push past his fear and ultimately
       decide, does he want a future with Ravi? Or is it game over?

       I’ve seen all the episodes and I was still put off by this one,
       although I think Mike talking over Rich the second time was the
       funniest part. It’s always been pretty clear to me that Mike and
       Rich have a friendship where shit-giving is the foundation, even if
       it’s more one person than the other.
       Overall though, I just plain didn’t think Mike and Rich were being
       very funny. I don’t think Josh was being a stick in the mud for not
       laughing at lame jokes. Sometimes I feel like Mike thinks some the
       jokes he makes are way more edgy and outrageous than they actually
       are. He seems pretty triggered by “PC culture” in general, always
       pointing out “YOU CAN’T SAY THAT” when certain jokes are made on
       HITB and BOTW even though he’s the only one that ever seems to make
       a big deal out of it.
       But whatever, it’s just one episode that I’m not a fan of, and to
       be fair the movies seemed especially shitty so I understand them
       going off the rails for much of it. I got some good laughs out of
       the episode, and I’m still a big fan of everyone in the group.

       So I expect the game to be impressive only on a technical level. I
       mean, it doesn’t have the creativity of Minecraft to get you
       hooked. How long can finding planets actually be interesting? I
       guess there’s space battles that could be cool but I don’t think
       it’s enough in the long run.

       Now, I’ve seen two of this episode’s featured films, and have that
       unaccountably excited feeling I get when I recognize some of the
       other potential films on display – I sort of wonder what the BotW
       crew would have made of the likes of Star Crystal which is one of
       those movies I saw back in the day on VHS – seemingly a standard
       “alien creature kills off crew members on a spaceship or something”
       as you’d expect from the 1980s.
       A slimy tapioca creature that came out of a chunk of crystal found
       on Mars kills off the crew of a spacecraft that survived the rather
       low-key destruction of a space platform until And Then There Were
       Two – the “twist” as such being that the creature is actually
       intelligent and having accessed the ship’s computer via the titular
       “star crystal” which is it’s own computer discovers that perhaps
       not all humans are belligerent and reads an electronic copy of the
       Bible. It spares the remaining two, saying it thought it was acting
       in self-defense, then begging for forgiveness.
       The surviving humans and the inexpressive, gloppy orange creature
       manage to get along despite the alien aka “GAR” speaking English by
       talking long raspy breaths between words – even to the point of
       playing some sort of tabletop game as part of a “pals doing stuff
       together” montage before GAR must depart and they say their
       goodbyes – then credits along with a song by Indira Stefanianna,
       the actress and singer perhaps best known as the original voice of
       Daphne on Scooby-Doo. Yeah.

       Also, Project: Metalbeast is one of those movies I saw haunting the
       shelves of many of video rental shop back in the day.
       The movie starts with a government agent who is the only survivor
       of an operation to procure a sample of werewolf blood in
       Transylvania, for use in a super-soldier serum project overseen by
       Col. Barry Bostwick. The surviving agent who had apparently made
       tracking down some werewolf blood his life’s work becomes
       belligerent, goes on a rampage and has to be put down with silver
       bullets. Years later a scientist played by Kim Delaney (this movie
       was made just before NYPD Blue, yes) has decided a metal-based
       artificial skin is the project she and her people need to devote
       their time to.
       The evil Col. Barry Bostwick convinces them to continue their work
       on body, not telling them it’s the cryogencially preserved body of
       his werewolf pal, who will of COURSE do whatever his old Col.
       orders him to do, the Colonel will be able to control him
       because…uh…OK Barry Bostwick didn’t seem to have taken any measures
       to control this guy and seemed to assume he’d just follow orders
       after getting his new armor-skin…so…well.
       The silver bullets removed, eventually the werewolf or rather
       Metalbeast busts out because someone decided the only thing cooler
       than a werewolf would be one with armor-like skin that goes on a
       rampage in a lab where the only security was…well there was a
       general there and a soldier accompanying him but not much in the
       way of any security for this top secret project. Delaney, some
       other guy and another lady who despite being the sort of character
       who usually doesn’t (SPOILER) actually makes it to the end of the
       movie make their stand against the beast, etc.
       The rather spiky-looking werewolf looks kind of goofy which is the
       word to describe the whole film. A b-movie throwback that, at the
       very least unlike trashy monster b-movies doesn’t seem to be made
       by people who actively hate their audience.

       I will say that Deathstalker should be lumped into the “foreign-y”
       category because it was a American-Argentinian co-production.
       Dr Butcher, M.D. is right out of Brad “Cinema Snob” Jones
       territory, and he would tell you that it’s one of those Italian
       horror films where there are multiple cuts of the film out there,
       thanks to general European anti-gore censorship and the short-lived
       British paranoia about children seeing grossout scenes in rental
       tapes of schlock movies (aka the “video nasty.”) I would bet good
       money that the original version of Dr. Butcher, M.D. had end
       credits (in Italian) and possibly had a scene where the cannibals
       ate the good doctor’s face off, but Paragon Video bought the
       hackjob English dub version.
       (The “video nasties” paranoia died out quick, but the damage was
       pretty extensive – they banned 72 previously-released films in
       1982, edited the hell out of many others, so that uncut versions
       would not be seen until the 2000s. All of the 72 had played in
       movie theaters in the US or Britain without any real issues, and
       most were horror films, with a sprinkling of Nazi sadism
       exploitation movies and “women behind bars” flicks.)

       Why does Joseph Gordon-Levitt sound like Keanu Reeves? Who is
       Nicholas Cage? Why does the movie think we’re dumb and use ‘flashy’
       animations to show computer graphics? And come on, September 16?
       Such a missed opportunity.

       Neill Blomkamp is resurrecting Newt’s character for his upcoming

       good reason.

       Bloomkamp went full Shyamalan with his second movie for me and it
       soured District 9 retrospectively a bit too. He is good at visual
       world-building, but every time someome opens their mouth it starts
       to go south. His metaphorical subtext fists are completely made of
       ham too, so with all of that I think they will just hammer in the
       theme of motherhood into a visually appealing film with distracting
       amount of plotholes (I hate plothole based criticism, but it was
       Prometheus and Elysium that made me rant the most in my life about
       stupid plots)

     * Sheriff Mitchell
       The ending of “Elysium” was the nail in the coffin for me.
     * tOmy`
       Well, we ain’t gonna hear the end of this anytime soon, so I might
       as well just join the ranks of masturbatory self-described
       reviewers jizzing all over the latest empowerment of Queen Bey,
       huh? Music Watch, bey!
       Beyoncé – Lemonade
       All the media circus, promotion and Piers Morgan yet again proving
       that we might just as well revoke his status of a human being
       aside, let’s talk brass tacks here. This is the 4th album in row
       where different pop queens took a fresh new shot at the pop circus,
       shattering of what is left of the term “pop queen”, while
       irreversibly distancing themselves from the genre itself. Cute.
       With a gun pointed at my head, I would almost say that I am happy
       about it. So what about Bey’s “deep and smart” addition to the
       fold?
       So you might have heard that the album deals with some heavier
       topics than we usually hear from these bozos, and it is true. I
       wouldn’t necessarily hammer too much on that whole “black
       empowerment” and “female empowerment” side of the coin tho, because
       the primary narrative is troubles in love paradise and alleged
       cheating. But hey, that is all fine and dandy, the word
       “introspection” is usually not associated with the Pop Queen
       Dictionary.
       We also have a bunch of big names featured on the album; Jack
       White, Weeknd, James Blake and Kendrick Lamar are there to support
       QB, surprisingly not just for marketing purposes (although “rock
       guy, R’nB guy, electro guy and rap guy” combo sure as shit helped).
       They all have their specific roles within the songs, all playing
       different characters to further enhance the lyrics.
       And then you have the sprinkling of different genres: couple of
       rock songs, country, blues, pop, gospel, dub… it’s a mashup of
       different styles and different influences, thus following the
       “distancing themselves from the genre itself” thing I talked about
       earlier. And, to my delight, it works for most of the time. Don’t
       Hurt Yourself and Freedom are pretty great stand out tracks,
       especially thanks to clever production and guest singers.
       So all in all, this is a surprisingly solid album. Maybe Queen Bey
       shouldn’t focus on three big topics and just keep it simpler, but
       hey, if she wants to use her status for something that is licking
       the rim of a concept album, then fine. 7.99999…/10

       people immediately stamp “GAMECHANGER” on a record I’m reflexively

       Well, the rap field is one big wasteland with some great names in

       I think the most hilarious thing about these pop icons is their
       attempt to push the pop crap into the future; you know,
       re-inventing, re-branding and re-smartening.
       Do you think anyone told them that the rest of the music has been
       there usually for like 10 years now? It’s like: “Wow, Beyoncé is
       doing a rock song! Wait till the other girls in the byz hear about
       that!”
     * Sheriff Mitchell
       That’s exactly why I roll my eyes whenever one of their new records
       is instantly branded as something that will change the face of
       music forever.
       I feel like the Adeles, Beyonces and Kanyes of the world stick
       their heads in the sand for years at a time, then remove them, see
       that things around them are different now and then decide that
       they’re the ones who discovered it.
     * tOmy`
       Then again, when they really do something different, we can at
       least all take the collective sigh of a relief that our prayers of
       not having the next dance-crap by Gaga, crippling ballad by Bieber
       or Disney-song by Miley on the radio has been answered.
       Sure, they will be very quickly replaced by some other fuckos,
       assaulting my eardrums and wondering why I even care about this in
       the first place, but I can always take at least some solace in
       that.

       If she’s getting flu shots AND STILL having strong flu-like
       symptoms… it’s either not flu OR her immune system is really messed
       up.
       If they keep diagnosing her with “atypical pneumonia” – it could be
       sarcoidosis.
       Which is both a bitch to diagnose AND an asshole of a disease that
       leaves you for decades and when it returns it scares you to death
       cause all symptoms point to cancers.
       I had colds regularly as a kid.
       Had flu ONCE. Scored across the board.
       Ended up with a secondary bacterial infection of heart muscle on
       account of not getting penicillin. Cause my regular doctor was out
       and the young one in her place decided to better play it safe than
       sorry with the dosage despite seeing from my chart that I never had
       issues with penicillin.
       So she prescribed a cough syrup for little kids to a teenager. And
       thus I found out how it feels when your chest is too heavy to
       breathe lying down.

       I think our hackfrauds got the wrong idea about Deathstalker. The
       script was originally an attempt at a gritty reboot of “He-Man”,
       emphasizing a more realistic portrayal of steroidal,
       loin-cloth-clad barbarians. Then those priggish studio execs got
       their claws on it, and skeleton makeup, scripts and production
       values were all declared out of budget.
       The accompanying toyline would have been inspired, though.
       RAPE-ACTION HE-MAN™ would have definitely outsold this guy:

       So I recently joined the RLM Message Board. The only reason I never
       joined it before is because every time I went to register it said
       that “The Board Admin has disabled registration”. I was surprised
       to find that they have no section for “Pre-Rec” on their message
       board.
       Then I saw that they have a section called “Red Letter Media
       Misc.”, which RLM themselves describes as “A place to discuss our
       other projects… In other words, our projects that nobody cares
       about.” This is where everyone discusses Pre-Rec. You’d think RLM
       would take a hint. Watching Rich Evans beg for tips on the internet
       is like finding out that your old friend from high school became a

       There was a meme I saw being passed around on Facebook that showed
       two jugs of processed lemonade. (I’d post a link, but…)
       Anywho, under a jug of “Simply Lemonade” (a respected brand) it had
       the name Rihanna. Under a jug of Wal-Mart brand “Great Value” was
       the name Beyoncé. A seemingly biting comparison at first glance
       that was supposed to illustrate that Rihanna was better than
       Beyoncé, but the creator of the meme seemed to miss that both
       lemonades were factory processed and sold in plastic jugs.

       Neither Lost in La Mancha, The Hamster Factor, Burden of Dreams nor
       Hearts of Darkness are “some fuckin contractual obligation
       throwaway press pack garbage to fill out space on a DVD”.
       At the same time, they all offer insight into the making of the
       movie, director’s process and psyche, the atmosphere on the set…
       All while staying informative – showing, not telling.
       Filming truth, not making up a personal fantasy about every single
       detail.
       Which is why you can watch them several times over, gaining NEW
       insight from subtle and not so subtle clues which were there all
       the time – but you didn’t see them as road signs to where the whole
       thing is going, cause you were too busy watchin the road.
       A.K. instead beats the audience on the head with CHRIS MARKER’S
       thoughts and understanding of the project.
       Presenting a single, narrow, interpretive… distorted and deformed,
       stylized version of events, people and even past works of Kurosawa.
       Cause fuck Kurosawa and his vision!
       It’s all about Chris and HIS vision and love for the “sensei”.
       Here! THIS is how you should look at Kurosawa movies. On a small
       screen on a bigger red and black screen.
       It’s no different than Harry Knowles making every single review
       about himself – instead about the movie and people who made it.
       Some “fuckin contractual obligation throwaway press pack garbage to
       fill out space on a DVD” would at the very least have informational
       value about the intent of the company (and thus society seen as a
       market for product) towards the movie and Kurosawa.
       Are they planing to market it to kids or old people? “Serious film
       enthusiasts” or “movie fans”? Is it a cash grab or a work of art?
       Nope. It’s just Chris Marker (or whatever) injecting personal
       emotions into someone else’s work.
       Good for you Chris. Found out you have emotions?
       Guess what?
       ~7 billion people have exactly the same amount of insight to offer
       as you did.
       Wanna bet most of them don’t say RAN is SHIT and Kurosawa is a
       BORE?
       Oh? You disagree? Well… should have offered some objective
       arguments – not subjective twaddle, setting the stage for criticism
       based on “I like thwordth” arguments.
       Should have made a documentary – not a movie about yourself and
       your own personal emotional states.
       Art of the documentary is in telling the truth by capturing the
       view of the subject from an objective angle.
       Be it an angle of some greater context or juxtaposition for
       contrast.
       Not to infuse reality with emotional experiences.
       That’s dramatization.
       Trying to mix those two in artistic fashion shits on both the truth
       aspect and the original subject of the “documentary” – it positions
       personal ego of the interpreter (who is thus degraded to just
       another audience member, only with more backstage access) above
       both the truth AND the original work he is interpreting.
       And all that is just scraping the crusty top of pretentiousness of
       A.K.
       Remove the appeal to authority fallacy by not telling people who
       made it and why any of his work supposedly carries importance (most
       of it coming from a carefully constructed “mystery” he maintained
       about himself) – and it’s just a bad student or fan film.
       You can almost imagine the author wearing thick rimmed hipster
       glasses, a goatee and a faux Vietnam era military jacket.

       Okay, so first and foremost, open a brand new tab in your Internet
       Explorer 5 or higher. When you open the tab, use your keyboard to
       enter the following letters: H and T and T and P and S. All of
       these can be found on your regular keyboard. Now enter a slightly
       disappointed emoji after that: :/. (That period was used for
       sentence separation, please, do not put a period after your
       slightly disappointed emoji.)
       Now put a second slightly disappointed mouth onto the emoji. Great!
       You are doing really well, want to take a small break? No? Okay.
       Now type www, which stands for “world wide web”, also known as the
       webzonemaker. Place a correct period after the www.
       Okay, now is the fun part! Because you are looking for a video, you
       should put “youtube” after the “world wide web” that is following
       the double slightly disappointed emoji preceded by htttp. Great!
       After typing “youtube”, which stands for You and Tube respectively,
       you can enter another slightly disappointed emoji, this time
       without the eyes tho. The eyes of the slightly disappointed emoji
       are this: :. (Please note that the period has nothing to do with
       the aforementioned eyes.)
       Great, we are making progress. Now, because you want to watch the
       video, you have to type the word “watch” into it. Just to make
       things a little bit more fun, place “v” and a questionmark behind
       the word “watch”. Done? Superb! To use the good ol’ math to have
       even more fun, imagine that the part “watchv?” is actually a part
       of an equation! And what do we do with equations? That’s right,
       Reginald, we put the international sign for equals there. Done? Now
       what does the first part of the equation equal to?
       Well, you gonna have to use the pen and write this down, because it
       is kinda complicated. You start by 2 and q and 1, followed by g and
       p and v l (not to be confused with capital i). Now press shift and
       type: L followed by 2 (for that you don’t need your shift on) and
       finalize this by Q and Y.

       Now we have to use words to describe what would’ve been a quick 2
       second joke.
       One day a man decides that he wants to become a monk, so he goes to
       the local monastery and talks to the head monk the monk agrees to
       give him a tour of the monastery. During the tour they pass a
       corridor with a strange sound coming from the far end. The guy asks
       the monk what the sound is.
       “I’m afraid I can’t tell you that because you’re not a monk”, the
       monk replies.
       So they continue their tour and after it’s finished the guy decides
       he will become a monk and is initiated into the monastery. After a
       few weeks he walks past the corridor again and hears the sound. So
       he goes to the head monk and says,
       “I’m a monk now, can you tell me what the sound is?”
       “I won’t tell you what it is”, says the monk, “but you can go and
       see.”
       So the guy sets off down the corridor. After a while he comes to a
       locked door so he goes to the monk and says,
       “There’s a door, can I have the key?”
       So the monk gives him the key and he sets off back down the
       corridor. He gets to the door and unlocks it and continues down the
       corridor. However he come to a second door, also locked, so he goes
       back to the monk and gets the key to the second door. And he goes
       down the corridor but he’s forgotten the key to the first door, so
       he gets the key to the first door and he opens the first door but
       he’s forgotten the key to the second door. So he gets the key to
       the second door and he opens the second door and he continues down
       the corridor. However he soon comes to yet another door so he goes
       back to the monk and gets the key to the third door.
       And he goes down the corridor but he’s forgotten the key to the
       first door so he gets the key to the first door but he’s forgotten
       the key to the second door so he gets the key to the second door
       but he’s forgotten the key to the third door so he gets the key to
       third door and he opens the third door and he continues down the
       corridor. However, he comes to a pool and he realises he will have
       to swim underwater to get across. Not knowing how far it is he goes
       back to the monk who gives him some scuba gear.
       And he goes back down the corridor but he’s forgotten the key to
       the first door so he gets the key to the first door and he opens
       the first door but he’s forgotten the key to the second door so he
       gets the key to the second door and he opens the second door but
       he’s forgotten the key to the third door so he gets the key to the
       third door and he opens the third door but he’s forgotten the scuba
       gear so he gets the scuba gear and he swims across the pool and
       when he surfaces on the other side he is faced with a fourth door.
       So he goes back to the monk and gets the key to the fourth door.
       And he goes down the corridor but he’s forgotten the key to the
       first door so he gets the key to the first door and he opens the
       first door but he’s forgotten the key to the second door so he gets
       the key to the second door and he opens the second door but he’s
       forgotten the key to third door so he gets the key to the third
       door and he opens the third door but he’s forgotten the scuba gear
       so he gets the scuba gear and he swims across the pool but he’s
       forgotten the key to the fourth door so he gets the key to fourth
       door and he opens the fourth door and he finds himself in a pitch
       black room. He can tell this is where the noise is coming from but
       he can’t see what it is so he goes back to the monk and gets a
       flashlight.
       And he goes down the corridor but he’s forgotten the key to the
       first door so he gets the key to the first door and he opens the
       first door but he’s forgotten the key to the second door so he gets
       the key to the second door and he opens the second door but he’s
       forgotten the key to the third door so he gets the key to the third
       door and he opens the third door but he’s forgotten the scuba gear
       so he gets the scuba gear and he swims across the pool but he’s
       forgotten the key to the fourth door so he gets the key to the
       fourth door and he opens the fourth door but he’s forgotten the
       flashlight so he gets the flashlight and he goes into the room and
       flicks on the flashlight But he doesn’t see anything because the
       flashlight has no batteries. So he goes to the monk and he gets
       some batteries.
       And he goes down the corridor but he’s forgotten the key to the
       first door so he gets the key to the first door and he opens the

       needing approval but it would be nice to know the rules. And I can
       understand if RLM finds us commenting here 24/7 kind of tedious.
       But I don’t want to get banned from here and if the jokes about
       japs and cosby are out of line I can understand that and I can drop
       them. We’ve had plenty off topic postings and commenting(plus
       rambling) and is that troublesome? What is?
       I feel uneasy at this moment cus there are no guide lines to what’s
       expected of us coming here. It would be nice to know.

       Here’s another though…
       “So there once was this wasp that lived in a jungle. This was not
       your ordinary wasp though-he was smart, philosophical even. One day
       he finally got fed up with his repetitive, insignificant life and
       decided that he would leave his hive, his family, his entire
       close-knit wasp community and he would go out into the world and
       make something of himself, just like the humans do. So the wasp
       enrolls in school, and passes with flying colors. Remember, this is
       a very smart wasp. He gets his high school diploma in a little
       under 3 years, with a 4.0 GPA and all that snazz. After high
       school, believe it or not, the wasp gets accepted to Harvard.
       Harvard! This too proves to be no challenge for our hero, as he
       graduates in just two years, again a 4.0, on the Dean’s list, and
       all that snazz. Not to mention all the clubs and sports he was
       in-the newspaper, rowing, student government-and the fact that he
       was by far the most popular student on campus. Even his professors
       looked up to him. He goes on to get two PhDs, and when he finishes
       his education, the wasp faces a bit of a dilemma. How does he apply
       his knowledge now? Where does he go from here? He decides to try
       out politics. After all, he was popular throughout school, did well
       in Harvard government. So he runs for mayor, and wins in a
       landslide. He greatly reforms the city, fixing virtually all its
       major problems. He runs for governor and again wins in a landslide.
       Two years later, the presidential election was coming up, and the
       wasp decides he might as well go for it. Of course, he wins in the
       largest landslide in US presidential history. His presidency goes
       exceedingly well-he is loved by all parties, and has the highest
       approval ratings in history. He also finds the cures for cancer,
       AIDS, and broken hearts while in the White House. After 8 years
       (yes, of course he was reelected) the time has come for him to
       leave his office. Even his successor his saddened by the wasp’s
       departure, but they all know it’s what must be done. Back at his
       vacation home in California his first day after leaving office, the
       wasp looks back on his long and fruitful life. He realizes that he
       hasn’t been back to his hive at all since that first day he left.
       He suddenly feels a twang of guilt as he realizes how much he
       misses his parents and his little brother. So he heads back to the
       hive, looking more worn out than he remembers. He goes inside and
       greets his family, who are overjoyed at the sight of him. He talks
       about how his life has gone as his family listens in wonderment.
       Eventually he decides he is thirsty, so he decides to visit the old
       watering hole he remembered. Once he gets there though, there’s an
       extremely long line. He decides it’s worth the wait, so gets in
       line. One hour. Two hours. This is the slowest moving line he’s
       ever seen! Eventually he calculates that it could be a few days
       before he gets to the front of the line, so decides it’s not worth
       it. He decides to go get some cider to drink instead, but waddya
       know, another huge line of people waiting for cider! He remembers
       one other drinking area that never had a long line-fruit punch! So
       he decides to go get punch. He arrives, and lo and behold, there’s
       no punch line.”

       Glad I’m not the only one who felt bad after this episode. It was
       unpleasant watching a group of usually smart and witty guys devolve
       into a pack of feral hyenas jockeying for a better spot in the
       pecking order. I’m friends with comics; wishing AIDS and cancer on
       each other is a daily occurrence. This episode just felt gross. If

       I may be stepping out of line here, but I think that, there is a
       general misuse of the comment section as a forum. This isn’t hard
       to understand as Disqus is probably too good at what it does which
       is being very quick and efficient way to carry on conversation
       threads.
       My guess is that Jay wants us to use the forum for all of these
       lengthy discussions as we probably should.
       It would be cool if Disqus would create some forum software so that
       the threads would be more instant.
       I don’t fucking know.

       “My guess is that Jay wants us to use the forum for all of these

       I vaguely remember having more than 5000 comments on TFA and people
       still managed to bitch it ain’t enough. Like what the fuck? Are we
       suppose to be machines, endlessly commenting 24/7 (sometimes for
       two weeks in row) about some topic in the video so when someone,
       who shows up here once a month and is unable to click “oldest”,
       gets what he doesn’t pay for?
       Or we can just go have these conversations somewhere else, so the
       bi-monthly person can come here and bitch about this place being
       deserted.
     * dollar store cashier wife
       Regardless of what we do they won’t care either way. Go wild with
       conspiracy theories friendo.
     * tOmy`
       Pretty much. But I prefer being ignored to being poorly moderated.
     * dollar store cashier wife
       Same here.
     * TheManHole
       Yeah this is pretty much what I have been saying all along they
       just don’t give a fuck. We could all stop posting forever and
       nothing would change. I’m so confident we will never get a response
       from a human being that if we do I will remove two of my vertebrate
       bend down backwards and eat my own ass.
     * dollar store cashier wife
       I’ll eat a copy of Space Cop if it happens. on Liveleak.
     * Sully
       No. The thing is they do care, otherwise they wouldn’t waste their
       time, or ours for that matter, deleting bullshit comments and
       banning people with no (read: no legitimate) cause to do so.
       Somethings, for lack of a better word, is triggering them. I just
       threw up in my own mouth.
       The problem is no one’s being the adult and addressing what the
       issue is, or where the guidelines are drawn. Fuck it. Whatever.
       I’ve got a stack of specs to get back to.
     * dollar store cashier wife
       Well they care in the most detached way possible I guess. I mean
       they are semi-consistent in banning andy and pa.
     * Sully
       Andrew asks for it in a lot of cases. Sometimes literally.
       I’m still confused as to why Pa gets the shaft so regularly.
     * Sully
       I’m still pissed about Omitted.
     * TheManHole
       What can we do though? They won’t respond and none of us are mind
       readers. How the hell do we follow rules that no one has set up?
     * Palpatine
       Pa’s banning really confused me.
     * TheManHole
       Which one? Then again one could argue that the second ban was for
       the same reason as the first.
     * Palpatine
       Are we even welcome in the forums?
     * TheManHole
       I think they hate us more then the reddit does and that’s saying
       something.
     * OMNI
       I’m just saying that this is a “comment” section. Made to be used a
       couple of times by members to comment. Forums are customarily used
       for lengthy topics. So that may be the reason for the ban hammer,
       too many posts. Like I said I don’t fucking know.
     * TheManHole
       That’s the annoying thing none of us fucking know and all the time
       it takes to ban people and delete their posts you think they could
       just respond to us but nope too fuck us.
     * OMNI
       I’m sure that banning someone is instant and deletes all of the
       users previous posts automatically. It’s seems Jay or Jack just got
       sick of some of us and said “Bye, bye”! As unfair as its seems this
       is RLMs territory and they have a right to ban whomever they
       please. Shitty but true.
     * dollar store cashier wife
       funnily enough but I think both reddit and the official board are
       about a million times worse.
     * TheManHole
       Your right and ultimately it does not really mater. We could all
       disappear and nothing would change. I just expected more which was
       silly of me.
     * TheManHole
       At least they are hidden from view so RLM is not embarrassed by
       them. We appear right under their video as a reminder.
     * Sully
       The irony of that is, most of our nonsense is but an echo of their
       own content, so…
     * TheManHole
       [Insert I learned it from watching you]
     * Bubs
       “My guess is…”
       See there’s the problem right there. It’s your guess. No one has
       communicated jack fucking shit to the rest of us. Which is why we
       just show up and smear shit all over the walls. Because no one told
       us not to.

       *probably* where this should be taking place yet I do not like the
       format and I felt that after reading some of the postings there it
       was more of K-12 environment as opposed to the near-adult one here.
     * OMNI
       Well…I just don’t fucking know,..FUCK!!!
     * TheManHole
       Oh I agree 100% this is completely their site to do as they please.
       We are nothing more then guests using it for our own pleasure, I
       don’t think anyone is arguing that. Where the frustration comes in
       is the silent treatment we are getting from the admins in regards
       to our comments. If they said something like “You guys can’t use
       this comment section as your own personal message board save this
       section for on topic comments only”. Then fine pack it in but
       instead we get silence. It’s not like we are all ban or the comment
       section closed just silence and that I believe is what has some or
       most of us frustrated with the whole situation.

       I am not very happy with this episode. It seems mean spirited. Yes,
       you are looking at totally shit movies, but the people making them
       have objectives and desires for their work There’s a best of the
       best of the worst video on youtube, and it shows how you all can
       make comedy gold out of deriding these terrible movies. You didn’t
       do it here. I would suggest a bit of detachment and arch irony.
       That is where the funny happens, when you treat shit like it’s
       something that matters, even when we all know it doesn’t.

       juice, people started going elsewhere, and it just faded away.
       You can probably see where I’m going. This may be the end, or at
       least the beginning of the end, of the RLM comment board. It’s been
       a lot of fun. Thanks to everyone for the creative snark, er, I

       Touche. But neurodiversity isn’t a real disability. The disability
       is society’s failure to embrace all normal humans. Meanwhile autism
       is very frequently not so much real, as it is someone using a word
       that gets them off the hook for dealing with life in a wholly
       one-sided fashion (“oh we weren’t talking about precisely that so I
       shall pretend I don’t understand you because I’d rather seem like

       His politics are an iconoclastic mess, yet his default position is
       to call anyone an idiot who doesn’t instantly take his point.
       Two years back (BoTW #17), he went from zero to 60 with Hale and
       LelouchetheFilial, over some minor ambiguity in his original post,
       when he could have cleared the whole thing up with a little calm
       talk.

       Coincidentally, I went through this not two weeks ago, on the

       imagined I could reason with the guy but, rather, because I knew
       that other, more reasonable people were likely reading along. So, I
       wrote for them.

       for 52 straight weeks. They then wrote their own version of the
       script from memory and the event is the live reading.

       Time is a valuable thing
       Watch it fly by as the pendulum swings
       Watch it count down to the end of the day
       The clock ticks life away
       It’s so unreal
       Didn’t look out below
       Watch the time go right out the window

       I tried so hard

       Acting like I was part of your property
       Remembering all the times you fought with me

       I’m sorry but this makes me laugh. This is part of my entertainment
       value of watching Redlettermedia. There’s another layer to it where
       they respond specifically to the whines of their hackfraud “fans”
       in little pokes and jabs that I don’t understand until I scroll
       around through the absolute idiocy that is a “fandom”. When they do
       the exact opposite of what self-righteous, self-entitled pricks on
       the internet tell them to do I laugh and enjoy myself even more.
       Even when they put Max Landis on – sure I don’t really care for the
       guy that much. But I actually liked that decision because everyone
       else didn’t. Call it what you want. Cynical… sadistic… but I like
       RLM best when they function how they want to function.
     * Variant
       While hearing people whine and watching them be disappointed and
       yet come back repeatedly is a minute part of what I find amusing
       about this comment board, having it or not I don’t see at all
       affecting my enjoyment of the content RLM puts out. You guys are
       weird.
     * Sheriff Mitchell
       Isn’t that the internet at large? Heaps of people whining about
       something they’re watching or listening to?
       It ain’t exactly an RLM exclusive.
     * [752][CENSORED] Shaqmeat
       We don’t demand anything from them in terms of content, we’re not
       the official forums where every other post is basically a less than
       polite Plinkett Review request or reddit where Jack is asked to
       answer every trivia question they can come up with. We’d just like
       to be treated fairly.
     * Sheriff Mitchell
       What do the self-righteous pricks tell them to do, exactly?
       It’s rare that I see anyone on here attempt to dictate to RLM what
       type of content it should be making.
       The only one I ever see (and rarely on here) is the horribly
       out-of-date “MAKE MORE PLINKETT REVIEWS,” and that’s basically
       older than Vaudeville at this point.
     * Variant
       Oh, certainly. That’s why I opted out of message boards permanently
       when I was like 18. Until now obviously. But that just more
       emphasizes the point I was actually making, which is that I’ve
       enjoyed RLM up to this point without having even bothered reading
       the comments down here for a good long time. Approximately when I
       made this account was not long after I read some of the
       inflammatory discussions going on here.
     * Variant
       Apparently I haven’t seen the worst of it then. Can’t you just get
       around the ban though? I used to hang out on a forum where people
       were banned for spelling mistakes. I thought that was funny too,
       though. Maybe I just lack the capability of taking shit very
       personally on the internet.
     * [753][CENSORED] Shaqmeat
       Some people did but then they started getting banned on a daily
       basis, whole discussions disappeared. That stopped being fun or
       productive and now links have disappeared. Oh well. You win some,
       you lose some.
     * Sheriff Mitchell
       I dunno, the discussions on here – in my experience – are rarely
       even about the videos themselves. Once a video has been up for a
       day, it usually goes completely off topic. And it remains fairly
       civil throughout that time.
       It only gets inflammatory when someone is banned for doing
       something that they had no clue was forbidden in the first place.
       Or when “Star Wars: The Force Awakens” is reviewed.
     * Variant
       Interesting. Well thank you for explaining a little more in detail
       as opposed to just engaging me in a battle of wits and insult,
       because I definitely wasn’t gentle in my analysis just barging in
       here like that.
     * [754][CENSORED] Shaqmeat
       Oh, don’t get me wrong, some of us really did push their buttons.
       There was something called a “gif war” long before I joined, where
       people posted gifs under some topic and from what I can tell,
       things went oveboard so it did warrant drastic measures like
       banning images but this time, were not exactly sure what we did.
     * Variant
       I don’t know I thought I’d been noticing a downward trend since
       specifically the Max Landis interview. And actually if you take it
       way back I always remember an influx of complaints and communal
       uproar every time RLM did anything different or added a new guest
       to their show (except those Canadian guys, who are pretty tough to
       dislike). First it was when they introduced Rich Evans as the new
       Plinkett for Half in the Bag. Then it was when Best of the Worst
       was a thing people said the same thing they said for Half in the
       Bag which was “Give us more Plinkett”, but now it was “give us more
       Half in the Bag”. Then it was when Jack was in Best of the Worst
       too much. Then it was “they havent done a Plinkett review in too
       long”. And then we’re basically back to the present as far as my
       mind can track it. I could just be horribly wrong and out of touch
       but what I see there is a trend
     * Sheriff Mitchell
       That smells like YouTube, to me.
     * Variant
       You might be right.
     * Sheriff Mitchell
       I mean, we get some mouthy passersby, but generally there’s 10-12
       of us that understand and usually enjoy the fact that RLM likes to
       shake it up.
       Except Pre-Rec. Most of the regulars hate Pre-Rec, though I’m in
       the minority there.
     * dollar store cashier wife
       Pretty good memory for someone who only recently created an
       account. I remember those complaints too but they came from random
       people who hate everything besides Plinkett reviews. The regulars
       stayed and enjoyed everything…sans PreRec.
     * [755][CENSORED] Shaqmeat
       I hate it in an endearing kind of way. They still don’t know
       anything about games, however. I do enjoy the streams where there’s
       Jay and when Rich and Jack play old adventure games. They seem
       semi-competent playing those.
     * Variant
       I watch it, I don’t feel one way or another on it though, it’s sort
       of last on my list. I don’t watch Let’s Plays so I can’t really
       find much entertainment in seeing one of their 2 hour long streams
       – so I might like it more if they had more review type content
       pumping out and if it weren’t so centralized on little cute indie
       games. Not as much finesse in presentation as Half in the Bag so I
       can understand people not liking it much at all.
     * Sheriff Mitchell
       Yeah, but I don’t know anything about games either so it doesn’t
       bother me. They’re usually reacting to things the way I do.
       The only thing I don’t like about Pre-Rec is the fake incompetent
       beginning of every episode. Like Jack trying to put his lavalier on
       or something. I usually skip the first 15 seconds or so for that
       reason.
     * tOmy`
       As I said somewhere below:
       I don’t honestly give a fuck when they ignore us or make fun of us.
       I am absolutely on board with it. But random bans affect people’s
       account and some of the regulars have been years. No need to change
       what seemed to work. The new rules / bans are, to put it simply,
       counter-productive and counter-intuitive. This has nothing to do
       with them showing contempt.
       They just fuck with something that worked rather well.
     * OMNI
       Think of Arrested Development. Every time Michael Bluth was “done”
       with his family he was right back there in the thick of it
       immediately. Same with us RLM fans. We aren’t going anywhere
       despite how dysfunctional are relationship with RLM is, Family is
       family.
     * dollar store cashier wife

     * OMNI
       Ahh back when I was a Rich Evans fan.
     * Variant
       Well I did say I enjoyed the entirety of RLM without reading much
       commentary at all so you could stick me for that – but what I
       actually mean is I’m very much guilty of skimming the top three or
       four comments every time because they’re kind of just right there.
       And as someone previously pointed out, the tone of quality in
       discussion I’m referencing might be more in line with Youtube. And
       on Youtube I have an account so a little bit of
       scrolling/bullshitting happens and I also sometimes catch RLM’s
       uploads within the first hour so that’s always nice.
     * Palpatine
       When I first started watching HitB, I didn’t care for Rich Evans as

     * tOmy`
       To be honest:
       Almost everyone who goes off-topic makes couple of on-topic
       comments. Always. Sometimes it’s easy, sometime it’s harder.
       But more importantly: We don’t discourage people who come in later
       to be either on topic, or join our conversation. If we were to tell
       them “Fuck off, we talked about the video whole day yesterday, you
       were busy working back then, so now you have to talk about Civil
       War / Trump with us!”, I would understand people disliking it.
       But we don’t do that.

       Good lord, the moderation approval is real.
     * The Wicker Man (BWF)
       So my original comment was that I went and saw The Room and The
       Neighbors as a double feature (for the first time) Friday night.
       Tommy Wiseau hosted and did Q and A. My link of sin was posting a
       38 second clip of a fan asking Tommy how he would have directed
       Batman VS Superman. Apparently, a youtube link is verboten now.
       Glad RLM has time to moderate their fans instead of doing any
       actual work. FRAUDS!
     * tOmy`
       Obvious jokes are obvious, but this one almost made me joke on my

       Good detective work. Add in Max Landis’s outlandish haircut, Rich
       Evans’s much-rumored nuptials, Jay’s transitioning from Susan to
       Reginald, and most importantly the whole Space Cop Blu-ray
       debacle–and you have all the ingredients of a major bust-up,
       flame-out, and self-immolation.

       How Tommy Wiseau would have directed Batman vs Superman. The

       set an example and GTFO. Put your money where your whiny mouth is.
     * Reginald Van Der Slythe III
       “The worst possible selections”?? That’s false advertising, you
       hack frauds; you got the best two that were up there. You didn’t
       pull Voodoo Black Exorcist or Viking Massacre. I haven’t seen Alien
       Chaser or Going Overboard but they’re probably horrible, too. I
       guess I understand that Italian zombie movies are an acquired
       taste, but considering that’s one of the better ones (well, Zombi
       Holocaust is; I haven’t seen the altered American version you
       watched) you should be happy. I mean, it’s not like you got stuck
       with Burial Ground or Nightmare City. Although, I would love to see
       your reaction to Zombie Lake someday.
     * Casey Samuels
       I hear you man, it’s not like this was Zombi 5: Killing Birds by
       the way. Nightmare City is pretty good though, yeah the makeup is
       pretty bad but, still way better than Burial Ground.
     * Casey Samuels
       I’d argue against destroying a rare VHS of Doctor Butcher MD, there
       are worse zombie movies out there.
     * Casey Samuels
       I’m saddened about the treatment of Doctor Butcher MD/Zombi
       Holocaust, that movie’s an honest cult classic and they didn’t even
       reference Fulci’s Zombie which it was a rip-off of and had the same
       main star. The general ignorance about that movie is staggering.
     * Casey Samuels
       That’s sad.
     * Casey Samuels
       That’s why I only watched Ran. Thank god.
     * Casey Samuels
       Actually there’s no print where they eat Dr. Butcher/Obrero. Doctor
       Butcher MD is the American release print of Zombi Holocaust,
       available on DVD from Shriek Show and soon Severin Films.
       The movie was a rip of Fulci’s Zombie from 1979 and stars the same
       guy even, Ian McCulloch from Scotland by the way. The ending
       credits do exist on the original version though.
       The American version removes the original score and shortens some
       dialogue and character scenes, but removes no gore or nudity. Plus
       a phony beginning was stapled on stolen from a unreleased movie.
       Hence, the whole opening zombie rising from the grave wasn’t part
       of the original cut.
     * Casey Samuels
       That’s nice, it wasn’t funny at all to me.
     * Casey Samuels
       Doctor Butcher’s been a pretty famous title among cult circles
       though.
     * Casey Samuels
       They have?
     * Casey Samuels
       No it pretty much sucked.
     * Casey Samuels
       When the reviewers are worse than the things they are reviewing,
       there’s a problem.
     * Casey Samuels
       It’s fairly ignorant garbage.
     * Casey Samuels
       That’s you.
     * Casey Samuels
       This is funny?
     * Casey Samuels
       Crickets. Yawn.
     * Strelnikov
       I was guessing about the fate of Obrero. Tacking on a fake opening
       is right out of Bruce Lee Fights Back From the Grave (1976) where
       they actually have a Bruce Lee impersonator leap out of a fake
       grave after the cartoonish tombstone is struck by lightning(!), and
       the rest of the film is completely unrelated. Having that footage
       be from an unreleased movie is something you would see in the
       cheapest Hong Kong action flicks; Joseph Lai produced a ton of them
       with Godfrey Ho, who would insert bits of his own actors into other
       people’s unfinished films and the results were dumped into
       direct-to-video VHS and foreign TV sales. Ho’s method is called the
       “cut-and paste”; he was the guy who gave us Pierre Kirby, the
       world’s most obscure ’80s action star.
     * Sheriff Mitchell
       H’okay.
     * Casey Samuels
       I’m sorry that was just plain incoherent tripe. I know I’m a month
       late to this game, but please.
     * Casey Samuels
       Aquarius Releasing was rather cheap but hilarious, they took a
       Japanese movie starring Sonny Chiba back in the day and released it
       as Viva Chiba! The Bodyguard with a tacked on quote from “Ezekiel ”
       and extra scenes of American martial artists talking happily about
       how great Sonny Chiba is. The Ezekiel quote should sound familiar
       by the way. Considering how a certain filmmaker used it in one of
       his 90s movies as a base for lines in his Oscar winning movie.
     * OMNI
       There was an element of sarcasm there. There were some funny parts,
       but yeah….
     * Casey Samuels
       I think mostly anything about Double Dragon, that part had the most

       This whole show is cute when it wants to be, you know Wheel of the

       from top to bottom.

       I can’t make you interesting.
       Rape however.. that’s interesting.
     * CapedBaldy
       I don’t think anybody would call this show cute. and I don’t think
       fans of this show care what filthy casuals think.
     * CapedBaldy
       Your opinion sucks.
     * Casey Samuels
       That’s nice. Even I don’t say that of you. Seems I respect you more
       than you respect me.
     * Casey Samuels
       Oh you die hard fans need to stop being so touchy.
     * Casey Samuels
       Rape is interesting? Ok, but bad rape jokes are not. Sorry.
