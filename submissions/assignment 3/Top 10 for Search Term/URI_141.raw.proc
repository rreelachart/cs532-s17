       HOLY shit I’m the first person to comment on RLM’s Super Bowl!

       Who’s that Richard fellow? Did you get a new employee? He reminds
       me of someone. Something to do with pizzas… and AIDS.
     * Glyph Wright
       The review was more entertaining than the film. I’m hoping for a
       Plinkett review of BvS. It’s just the right type of entertainingly
       bad.
     * crymo
       Oh yes. I have been waiting all weekend for this to turn up. Now
       here it is at last. And I am ready. Pint of vod and coke. Twenty
       Marlboro. Box of Kleenex. Tube of body chocolate. Trousers round
       ankles. Press ‘Play’.

       Why is Perry White so insistent that he write an article about a
       Pee Wee Baseball Team. Is his kid on the team or is Perry White
       looking to score with some hot Soccer Moms.

       Who can blame him? He’s put on weight since The Matrix movies.
     * [56]CherryValance
       While I enjoyed the movie, I didn’t disagree with you guys that
       much. I just dropped any ideas I’d had about Batman and Superman
       from my childhood before I went in. It’s much better that way. I
       think there’s no way around this being a movie set in 2016. It
       can’t be happy. All the stuff with the government and the press was
       pretty spot on. They’re either asleep at the wheel or making things
       worse, and they would do the same thing with superheroes if given
       the chance. That’s what I liked about it. But dour was the exact
       word to describe it. Little kids should just stay home. It’s just
       not that kind of superhero movie.
     * crymo
       Oooh, what’s that for? Sounds filthy!

       Put it on an infinite streaming loop on youtube.
     * ashwilliams
       You anchor to much on “classic Superman” and “classic DC Universe”,
       and it’s weird because you acknowledge that “Reeves Superman” can’t
       exist today.
       That’s why you keep getting dissapointed, you did that too with
       Ghostbusters o TMNT (where you keep referencing the animateds shows
       or original movies like a point of reference) but that’s past and
       done. Quality is another topic, TMNT suck and Ghostbusters looks
       terrible but there are things that have to change and evolve.
       Superman has to be questioned in a “today movie” like will be real
       life, it cant be corny superman, just cant be, then you will
       complain that’s too inocent. Maybe cant be a modern Superman, maybe
       the carachter is just done, is from another time, but even if they
       fail, i think the path was correct
     * Domo
       So what do you guys think will show up on Bandcamp’s merchandise
       page first?
       That Lightning Fast VCR repair hat?
       A night in Rich Evans’ foxhole?
       Or a Superman IV: The Quest for Peace commentary track?
     * Geahk Burchill
       It’s so dense! Every single image has so much Turkish Airlines.
     * dollar store cashier wife
       the second one will show up on craigslist. with a tag: “name your

     * [62]Bagg of Stool
       Wouldn’t qualify as an glorified reaction video/tape?

       I’m gonna paraphrase what I read somewhere else. Superman should be
       DC’s Captain America. Not a pacifist, but a hero that embodies
       decency.

       I’m having a Harvey Korman clicking flashback! I still have PTRLMSD

       I could see a Junkie XL soundtrack featuring this composition

       I liked your idea of the writer’s for the cartoon Justice League
       show just being the big honchos for the DCCU. Zack Snyder is just
       slowly bleeding them out without even realizing it.

       I am so sad we never used this in Europe.
     * Wizard Phoenix
       DC Fan here who liked the movie. Listen here, fanboys, if you can’t
       see the giant problems with this movie you have to talk to more
       people Or get laid. I’m Wizard Phoenix, I’ve gotten laid. You can
       too.
     * Sully
       Has someone posted the review in their comment’s section yet?
     * [73]One More Thing
       Yeah. Don’t worry, Wizard P, my non-stop two days of trolling
       should lead them right back here. Kind of like when you are
       fishing, what’s it called when you are trying to attract fish in a
       slowly moving boat? What’s it?

       Max Landis was a good Lex Luthor.
     * Hank_Henshaw
       I don’t know. The general public, a majority of it ,might actually
       prefer this madness. This movie will be right on target with the
       amount of money WB was expecting it to make, and the critical
       failure will be interpreted as critics being out of touch with what
       the people want. See the Transformers movies for further reference.
     * Domo
       Does anyone have any thoughts on what Jesse Eisenberg was thinking
       during Gal Gadot’s “Strong, beautiful side of women… finally”

       I have the same Sony headphones as Rich in the Video. This model is
       getting marketed as a part of their DJ Headphones collection
       actually. Rich must have felt addressed, with sentences like…
       You love the club, it’s your second home. You need a set of DJ
       headphones to perfectly play back that sound and get the bass
       thumping.
       Comfort is paramount, as you spend most of your time listening to
       your
       favourite tracks and DJ mixes. These DJ headphones get you closer
       than ever to that dancefloor adrenaline. With accurate sound
       reproduction and audio separation, everytime you put them on is
       like stepping back in the club.
       …it’s that or the cheap price.
     * Sully
       I want to see that round head silhouetted against the screen all
       MST-style. I’ll pay, guys. Do you accept Republic Credits?

     * tOmy`
       That is such an odd marketing for DJ headphones.
     * Hank_Henshaw
       Did the dial up modems sound different in Europe, or you just mean
       the AOL service?
     * tOmy`
       AOL.
     * Wizard Phoenix
       I actually thought Batman and Wonder Woman where the sexiest-I mean
       the best part of the movie. I might ship them but I won’t because
       only people who need to get a life do that.

       Also I disagree with DC not having cool villains, part of the fun
       of Paul Dini’s Justice League Unlimited was all the side characters
       If Paul Dini ran the franchise instead of Hack Synder, if would
       have been better

       Zack Synder not only not understand Superman, he doesn’t understand
       heroism
       Which is why he’s doing an Ayn Rand movie, Superman seem unconcern
       with other people aside Lois and his mom, Henry Cavill looked has
       basically the same impression as me when I lost my wallet at the
       senate bombing.
       Ans some people called The Incredibles an objectivist superhero
       movie (how appropriate Mrs Incredibles was there at the senate)
       Ma Kent might as well said “with great power, comes personal
       responsibility to further capitalism”

       I disagree that DC has mostly lame characters, I’m a DC fan, though
       I barely read comics, but Paul Dini, Greg Weisman, and Glen
       Murakami, used DC characters very well with their animated shows.
       Also there’s a better to have a meta discussion of Superman,
       Superman vs The Elite was amazing

       Do kids give a crap about Bill Murray, do kids even pay attention

       that there’s a manor animated movie with three leads done by
       professional voice actors and not lazy celebrities

       for disliking this movie for perfectly valid reasons. Instead of
       saying “I like BvS for these subjective reasons” they say “Yeah?
       You’re a fuckin’ Marvel fanboi! Go suck Stan Lee’s dick, you should

     * Omnis Odium
       I think the DC characters can be a bit lame, especially some of the
       Silver Age characters (Crazy Quilt for example) but I think they
       have the more intriguing plot lines for the most part.
       Marvel on the other hand, I think I like the characters more over
       all, and I definitely think the greater universe is more
       interesting as a whole, but Marvel also takes a lot of risks, and
       they tend to be less mature/their plot lines are often simpler, so
       that means they’ve done a lot of stupid plot lines and cringe
       inducing stuff, lol, but at the same time, since they’re willing to
       take risks I think they also get some really cool spin offs.
       (I said DC had better plot lines for the most part, but the Doom
       spin-offs are my favorite stories, to me they are the epitome of
       good comic book writing; ‘Books of Doom’, ‘Secret Wars’, and ‘Dr.
       Strange and Dr. Doom’ in particular.)
       So yeah, my point is, I think DC has some lame characters, hell,
       even Superman is kind of lame, at least in some ways, but I like
       both DC and Marvel, just I think they are better in different ways.

       Death of Superman is just the prologue of A World Without Superman

       It’s not that they didn’t care it’s that they were given the option

       They could be.
       They should be as good as their writers.
       E.g. You can’t knock Neil Gaiman cause motherfucker can write.
       To a certain extent same could be said about Alan Moore.
       Even Grant Morrison and Warren Ellis can at least write a fresh
       take on things.
       Problem with a lot of comics is that they are built on the stories
       written by people who could not sell their writing elsewhere as a
       book or a movie script – and who were then hired to write lowest
       denominator crap.
       Stuff literally aimed at illiterate children and retarded grown
       men.
       Toilet paper material.
       The other part of it is that the industry simply can’t afford good
       work.
       Cause no matter how good a writer someone is, writing rigidly
       commissioned stories (strictly defined characters, themes,
       locations, rules…) on a weekly deadline will nearly never produce
       high quality work.
       Which is why all the really good stories are limited series – not
       “events” and ongoing series.
       Same as with movies. Best ones don’t have roman numerals in the
       title.

       The movie was pretty good, but I had some problems with the movie.
       1. The color desaturation. It was completely unnecessary. Darkness
       of subject matter doesn’t have to mean literal darkness.
       2. Batman’s motivations to fight Superman. Why is a Batman with
       twenty years of experience such a hot head? Why does he make
       assumptions about Superman instead of trying to learn about him?
       How dumb is he to think the bombing of the Capitol was Superman’s
       fault? Be a detective and stop raging.
       3. Doomsday. I had forgotten that Doomsday was in the movie. When
       Lex placed Zod’s body in that genesis pool, or whatever, I thought
       there was going to a Bizzaro Superman. I know next to nothing about
       the comic book Doomsday, but I’m pretty sure this one was
       inaccurate.
       4. Too much in one movie that just barely held together. But, it’s
       all out of the way.
       I think it would be smart to make any single character movies a bit
       lighter in tone. For example, don’t make a Flash movie grim.
       Another Superman, now that all of the mistrust is out of the way,
       should be fun, or at least an even toned action movie without any
       world shattering stakes. Just make a standalone Superman movie.

       Superman II as well when she was Sarah Douglas. Lex Luthor is an
       all time great baddie, so I agree there. I am agreeing with the ‘he

       Mark 16:1-8
       Jesus Has Risen
       16 When the Sabbath was over, Mary Magdalene, Mary the mother of
       James, and Salome bought spices so that they might go to anoint
       Jesus’ body. 2 Very early on the first day of the week, just after
       sunrise, they were on their way to the tomb 3 and they asked each
       other, “Who will roll the stone away from the entrance of the
       tomb?”
       4 But when they looked up, they saw that the stone, which was very
       large, had been rolled away. 5 As they entered the tomb, they saw a
       young man dressed in a white robe sitting on the right side, and
       they were alarmed.
       6 “Don’t be alarmed,” he said. “You are looking for Jesus the
       Nazarene, who was crucified. He has risen! He is not here. See the
       place where they laid him. 7 But go, tell his disciples and Peter,
       ‘He is going ahead of you into Galilee. There you will see him,
       just as he told you.’” 8 Trembling and bewildered, the women went
       out and fled from the tomb. They said nothing to anyone, because
       they were afraid.

     * Skewed_View
       I think Man of Steel is the better movie. At least I can root for
       Superman in that one, he was a total jerk in this movie.
       Also, MoS has an easy to understand story with a beginning, middle
       and end (even though the end is a long drawn out fight). BvS is
       just stuff happening in an attempt to set up future movies, with
       barely a story holding it together.

     * bleurgh
       Nolans trilogy was still escapist in spite of it’s realistic and
       dark tone. Also I think a dark tone works better with Batman and
       that’s part of the reason people are being more generous to the
       batman components of this movie. Also I think that Nolans trilogy
       was becoming more absurd and pulpy by the time they got to The Dark
       Knight Rises and was hoping they would go in a very different
       direction with Man of Steel and the subsequent DC films. Instead
       they chose to double down on the darkness, making it unrelentingly
       grim, whilst throwing realism out the window and making everything
       dumber. Making the Batman story darker, more adult and realistic
       was an interesting stylistic choice and necessary after what
       happened to the series before, but when that tone is turned up to
       11, done by a shittier film-maker an applied to a character who is
       supposed represent the the exact opposite of darkness it’s a recipe
       for disaster.

       I agree, but I’m wondering what the ape to hero ratio would have to

       scene needs a beginning middle and end, this was like watching
       jerky cuts to pieces of scenes randomly scattered around some
       action set pieces. Also the maudlin forced dark vibe came off as
       humorous in the way it resembled a shitty soap opera. Again I
       wouldn’t care if this movie was Superman laser decapitating popes
       if it weren’t so fucking stupid and boring.

       The murdering is interesting. Or as Snyder claims manslaughter. Oh
       please.
       It’s always the tone of the movie and the substance of the
       characters that decide weather we like the killings or not. I still
       think the 89 Batman is the most brilliant farcical adaptation of
       comicbook camp. Lets have a look.

       Its dumb, campy and corny but Burton sold it.
       Fastforward and he made another where the killing is just off the
       charts. Burton went full Stamos on that one. I’m sure he did not
       care about the movie and didn’t want to make it. And OMG is it BS.
       But its also hilarious and Burton knows it. Its my favorite Batman
       movie because it’s Shumacher camp done right and anything goes. Its
       so twisted and disorted. And this is a comicbook on a movie. Lets
       have a look.

       I will agree that a Reeves style Supes wouldn’t work today, but for
       the love of god WB let him be bright and cheery and likeable! He’s
       supposed to contrast batman like rich said. He’s supposed to be the
       one that takes the braver choice, the kinder choice, the better
       choice. And not because he can lord it over people, but because
       he’s that good of a person.
       And while I can see some news segments decrying superman (that
       could add nice world building like having Lex leading the anti
       superman campaign on twenty four hour news inbetween his business
       meetings)
       I mean, you can have a more grounded film, with stakes and world
       shattering consequences and still have well written, fun and
       likeable characters. Cap America is a great example of a Superman
       type done very well in a modern film. Winter Solder even had some
       modern day concerns used as themes. Cap is serious when he needs to
       be, but can be sarcastic, charming, nice, funny and witty during
       less tense moments. A movie needs that other wise it’s a slog.
       I hate what WB and Synder have done to superman and even batman.

       supposed to be fun.

       I thought Superman was gonna melt or heat up the gun in the black

       montage scene of people betterer. Simply have him be welcoming and
       happy to save people but as soon as people start to touch him or
       pray to him have him feel uncomfortable or even scared. Start it
       off happy then make it question shit. But I have a feeling this

       During the scene when Bats was chained up by his wrists in the

       Sigh… RLM boys, what are you doing!
       Re watch the movie and follow the characters plots and
       developments. The 3 main characters are fleshed out, with their
       motivations as all 3 play cat and mouse with each other (also
       remember this is a sequel too) . First 1.5 hours is most
       interesting as they take time to develop characters and is more of
       a psychological thriller during this portion, but the intelligence
       seems lost on you ( maybe cause all you want is a “fun” , one liner
       “witty” and big brightly coloured action marvel movie made for
       babies ) This movie is smarter than most super hero movies and yes
       set in real world with real character traits, which aren’t too hard
       to follow along if you’re a big boy.
       Only part which was confusing as fuck is the batman dream sequence
       in the desert with evil superman and then the flash giving him the
       warning, but this is a mystery piece which will be explained later.
       Rich found the explanation , but gave up on it. and that is that
       the warning comes from future flash who has time traveled to give
       the warning… which means the dream sequence PROB does happen, but
       in the future, the future of spaaaaaaace, but in the future( after
       batman bangs louse lane and explains why superman is emo and angry
       and hints at this in his dialogue during that scene). To average
       movie go’er this would be pretty “wtf?” but would get the payoff of
       explanation in the in obviously 1 of like what 10? future movies
       scheduled in this universe.
       Fuck I’m not even a DC fan or anything. but to see people who love
       the art of Cinema, rip a somewhat (not even the most) intelligent
       movie from ALL THE WRONG reasons… is disappointing. I have prob
       about 10 talking points of disagreements with their comments which
       would be nullified if they paid attention to the movie .. maybe if
       this comments gets enough lime light I’d take the time to flesh em
       out.

       Anywho while I never expected ye to like the movie, watching it in
       3D in the front side row was a terrible idea. In the best of movies
       that would be a bad idea. As for the “dream sequence” I don’t think
       it was. I figured it was Flash going back in time to warn batman,
       if he hadn’t, what played out in the desert was what would have
       happened. It was probably a bit too comic booky for general
       audiences.. I presume batman stealing the kryptonite will be on the
       directors cut.
       BTW I didn’t like man of steel, although I get what they where
       going for, the shaky cam gave me a headache..

     * [156]‘Undercover’ Nass
       Are you serious(legit question)? It treats its audience with
       contempt. Superman is “God” and Bruce fears the end is near for
       humanityand must find a way and Lex is the middle man trying to
       kill this “God” and tricks SM into a fight with him. Intelligence
       is not confusing the obvious with bad editing. Its a simple story
       with a clear concept witch is convoluted and sloppy. And they even
       throw more stuff in there.

     * Variant
       That I can’t disagree with. And let it be noted I was not defending
       this movie at all, merely pointing out that there’s a place for
       dark/serious comic book movies. Superman is the absolute worst
       venue for this however, and it was handled terribly. I will agree
       that generally speaking the tone of a superhero movie shouldn’t
       make you feel depressed, serious or not. Maybe there’s a place for
       that but I’m not keen to what that might be.
     * Doctor Andre Son of Thomas.
       also. you wrote a massive essay and abbreviated Probably to prob
       twice?! did it save time?
     * Eric Catfacts Rion
       I wish I could! Me too dumb to understand Snyder-brain!
       My guess is that they probably wanted to make it more “realistic”
       and “darker.” That would explain all the congressional hearings and
       terrorist attacks. Plus giving the devil his due, Snyder didn’t
       write the story- David Goyer did. So it was David Goyer that
       decided to make Superman “Batman with powers” and make everyone a
       dumb asshole.
     * Doctor Andre Son of Thomas.
       Watchmen should be depressing, Punisher should be dark and murder
       people… Superman should be a saviour and batman should be
       conflicted. they shouldn’t be insane murderers.

       Well so was I. I had to think hard on it. Even discuss it with a

       again. Its even debated on the internet what everything means. They
       did adress it all but they talk about it in a movies perspective.

       I actually followed along real nicely live during the movie. and
       appreciated they didn’t take me for an idiot and could follow their
       logical jumps in conclusions they took here and there, it was
       refreshing, especially in a super hero movie. Like i said, that
       sand dream sequence was the only take away bit for my mind to chew
       on , but i’m sure it’ll be paid off in future movies.

       Ok fair enough. Glad you liked it. =) (sincerily)
       They got Bruce W motivation down. They did miss the motivation for
       Lex (15:00) they touched on it but I don’t know if they could
       explain it to satisfaction. And they would not care. I think they
       understand but left it out.
       Um the dream wich Bruce had while nappin at work while waiting on
       the decryption is problably easy to understand.
       1 Bruce is afraid that the world is doomed and we see him in an
       apocalyptic future going after the weapon to defeat superman.
       2 He think he gets it but is set up and falls victim to the nazi
       thugs.
       3 Superman comes and is evil. A monster. That kills him before he
       wakes up.
       4 Its totalitarian symbolism. Nasis running things worshipping
       evil.
       5 Bruce views SM as evil thats why he is a monster in his dream.
       6 SM kills Batman because he knows he can not defeat him.
       Freud and dreams and Neitze. It’s just so terrible. I understand
       the concept but it has to be cohercive as a script. I love this
       type of stuff in movies. I activekly look for movies that give a
       challenge. I think I also understand when it does not work. I’m
       sure it will be poster material to defend the movie but there comes
       a point when it turns to shlock. Watchmen had a balance but SvB
       just endlessly puts things in there.

       Dumb kids just can’t understand this awe-inspiring, mature take on
       Superman’s character.
       After all, the key to being a mature adult is to only help people
       in ways that makes you comfortable, throwing hissy fits when things
       don’t go your way and achieving goals through threats and
       intimidation.
     * moleman124
       As for the motives in the scene, sure . yours are more than
       plausible
       the reason the scene makes no sense is, he is going after
       cryptonite in the dream … but this is during the downloading of the
       information that leads him to cryptonite. so at the time of
       dreaming, he doesnt know about it!! but then the flash appears, my
       theory is so most likely the flash implanted that “future vision”
       within his dream, so he would know.

       Might be, BUT now we are lost. Why cant he just tell him? In the

       the scene around, Flash appears while he sleeps and “whispers”
       while Bruce has a dream. They must have understood this… they must
       have. I’ve struggeled to understand the decisions they made in the
       script but oh… its beond.. and more more more more

       That is the standard motivation for Lex Luthor that spans Superman

       You are that perennial klutz, Clark Kent. Once again, you’ve locked
       yourself out of your apartment and the only person with a spare key
       is your landlord who lives across town.
       Do you:
       (A) Call your Landlord, explain your situation and ask if you can
       drop by, pick up the spare key and get a copy made at your expense.
       (B) Change into your Superman outfit. Fly to your landlord’s home
       via the quickest route, through downtown Metropolis, collapsing
       several high-rise buildings and leaving behind a trail of human and
       economic carnage.
       Grab your landlord by the scruff of his neck and fly home via an
       alternative route that unleashes a second wave of destruction upon
       the city, while bellowing reassuringly in his terrified face: “If I
       wanted to kill you, you’d be dead already.”
       Lose patience when your landlord is unable to stop trembling long
       enough to unlock the door to your apartment. Blast through the
       supporting wall with your heat vision causing the floors overhead
       to subside and begin crumbling into the street below, killing and
       injuring hundreds. Snap your landlord’s neck in front of a troupe
       of girl scouts who have been going door-to-door selling cookies.
       Enter what remains of your apartment. Change back into your
       civilian clothes. In the guise of Clark Kent, write a glowing
       review of the new Ghostbisters trailer for The Daily Planet.

       It may sound funny, but I actually don’t play this game. I played

       However, I find it incredibly fascinating how utterly spectacularly
       you can fuck up a videogame that cost a quarter of a billion
       dollars to make. For me, the forums for this game are a scientific
       study of how NOT to make a game. It’s sort of the videogame
       equivalent of Batman V. Superman. It’s clear that the creators just

       Isn’t this a case where an origin story in a feature film would be

       Maximum Carnage at least has a point though. It’s 90’s as fuck, but
       it was essentially “The Dark Knight” for Spider-Man; just how far
       would Peter have to go to bring down a threat that really was like
       nothing he had ever faced before?
       Plus, looking back on it, it’s actually nice to read a series where
       a bunch of heroes are working together against a larger threat
       instead of at each others’ throats constantly, even if they did
       have some idealogical differences.
     * WrongWithYourFace
       He has all the basketball courts! No one will ever have as great a
       collection of basketball courts as him!
     * Snake Squeezer
       I don’t have a problem with how dark this movie is and the fact
       that everyone is a violent murderer. I would imagine the fact that
       I’ve never been into comic books has a lot to do with it. But for
       me, it’s just a different approach to the characters. The problems
       I have with the movie have more to do with not knowing what the
       hell was going on half the time, and little bits that were just too
       over the top, like the burglar putting his gun in Bat Mom’s pearl
       necklace and breaking it / shooting her point blank in the face
       when the gun fires (or kicks or whatever you call it, I’m not a gun
       guy). That part was a real howler. And the part where Supes blasts
       into the African(?) terrorist(?) when he has Lois as a hostage.
       That was hilarious. But the tone? I have no problems with that.

       Fun fact about Superman; in DC lore, the “S” symbol on his chest is
       his family crest and actually an old Kryptonian symbol meaning
       “hope”, sorta like old European heraldry for families.
       In BvS, there’s wonderful scene where Lois asks Clark what the “S”
       symbol stands for. He looks at her and simply states, “It meant
       something on my world. And my world is dead now.”
       Yep, hope is dead in the Snyderverse. No Blue Lanterns for you.

       Two sentences later though…
       Batman v Superman’s Friday-to-Saturday drop came in at 38%, second
       worst only to The Dark Knight Rises’ 40% drop.
       BTW… That actually makes it 27th on the list, which should be
       called something like “Cherry Picked stats of no relevance”.
       TFA is 15th.
       The last Harry Potter movie is 5th. The one before it is 26th.

       Calm your tits, Gumby.
       I think the key phrase was “superhero movie.”
       Fandom films tend to burn bright, but fade fast. It’s in their
       nature since most of those moviegoers are rabid fans, and all see
       those movies within the span of the opening weekend (more than once
       for some).
       Batman v. Superman is merely the fastest fading superhero film so
       far, and this drop is likely due to word that the movie didn’t live
       up to what it promised to be.

       Do these fuckers know what “critic proof” means or how much
       marketing plays into a movie? Apparently they don’t know shit about
       anything. Listen here, fanboys, your movies that are coming are not
       going to just disappear because of what critics say. What matters
       to the studio about critics is how much they can their future films
       better. And they only do that because of money. If for example BvS
       had a Rotten Tomatoes score of 85% percent then that would mean
       more money because people hear the movie is pretty good and use
       that score as an example. God I hate fanboys.

       A friend from India told me about the movie theater experience

       There is incessant chatter and conversation throughout the
       screening. Only when the hot chick appears or an action/chase scene
       occurs do people really pay attention – and then only to loudly
       hoot and holler at the screen. Once the movie calms down, the din
       of two hundred people talking returns.

       93%, that’s when I realised, critics have a Marvel bias and just
       hate DC.

       If you thought Batman V Superman was bad just wait for Star Trek 3
       (current generation).
     * Like Icare
       Ok… so… until the movie actually comes to my fucking village
       (Seriously… it’s embarrassing. They know they’ll be playing next
       Melissa McCarthy turd but they can’t yet tell if they’ll be able to
       scare up a copy of Batman v Superman.) I downloaded the shitty CAM.
       Which wasn’t that shitty. In more ways than one.
       Seriously guys… I find that the general sentiment here is about as
       off as that on Batman News – only more embarrassing.
       I mean… they have a reason for their lack of objectivity.
       So… I was prepared to see something that is Fan4tastic bad – and it
       turns out better than Man of Steel.
       I expected something confusing… and it turned out to be no worse
       than Avengers 2.
       Even all that “Murderman” and “techno music” Mike mentions is blown
       out of proportion – Batman is in that same gray area he was in
       Batman (1989) when he blows up Ace Chemicals full of Joker’s goons
       or when he drops Harvey Dent in The Dark Knight or rams that
       garbage truck (driver and all) into the ceiling, or leaves Ra’s Al
       Ghul to die (both of them), explodes a mountain stronghold full of
       ninjas (along with that guy he refused to kill), or kills the
       driver of the bomb truck along with Talia Al Ghul.
       He sure as fuck wasn’t firing rubber rockets there…
       As for techno… meh… it’s apparently Wonder Woman’s theme. It’s Hans
       Zimmer crap, but I guess it’s not THAT bad.
       Now… What IS bad… Eisenberg. Terrible, horrible, shitty, crap bad.
       OK… I get it. They are STILL working that Superman: Birthright
       template, cherry picking pieces from it without rhyme or reason.
       But still… that character doesn’t work. It barely worked in that
       comic.
       Here though, he’s not insane enough to be guided by his insanity,
       he’s not sane enough to be cold and methodical.
       All his motivation apparently comes from… I don’t know… daddy was
       beating him so he’s angry at god?
       In the end they do KINDA give him some retroactive character
       development, hinting that he went insane from “seeing things”… but
       he was clearly mentally unstable all along.
       Also… Holly Hunter.
       Who is, unfortunately, such a good actress that it takes you a
       moment to realize that her character has no other purpose but to
       die.
       That entire subplot leads nowhere… Well… except to Kevin Costner’s
       talk about dead horses.
       Which also feels out of place and without a reason for existence.
       So yeah… nowhere.
       Just like that OTHER senator who gives Lex all his toys.
       Who seems to only be there because they were uncomfortable with Lex
       feeding Holly Hunter candy and licking his fingers afterwards.
       Which really doesn’t make sense when we know that she got an Oscar
       nomination for “vacuuming” Gary Busey in The Firm.
       Which gives that movie’s title a whole new meaning.
       But anyway… since we still need Lex to be menacing to her… Jar of
       piss.
       And since we need a scene where Lex chews the scenery while talking
       about gods… he supposedly needs an import permit for kryptonite.
       Killing people – not an issue. But you gotta obey them import laws
       and regulations.
       Seriously, you don’t want to fuck with US customs.
       Again… cause they’ve created a Lex who is an aspie, he can’t be
       properly arrogant and lofty to use his assistant as an exposition
       tool.
       You know… the way Batman uses Alfred when something needs
       explaining to the audience.
       Which would cut down the number of senators, make the bombing of
       the senate hearing more sensible (tying off loose ends) and explain
       all the points they felt were too confusing to the audience.
       Like that whole chase that gets interrupted by Superman followed by
       Batman leaving his calling card for Lex – as if Luthor doesn’t
       already know that Batman is after the kryptonite. You know…With
       that whole convoy of his shot to shit and all that.
       But I guess it was confusing to the audience to just show an empty
       box…
       Leave that shot out and Luthor suddenly comes of like a much bigger
       schemer.
       As if it was his plan all along for Batman to take the kryptonite –
       which is why he had a convoy drive it around instead of just flying
       it in a helicopter.
       But no… too complex for US audiences.
       Then there’s that bit with “Martha”… which would make a lot more
       sense if the deus ex tempus machina said “Marth is the key to all
       this.” instead of Lois.
       BTW… Am I the only one to notice that the “mysterious time
       traveler” wears some kind of a mechanical armor suit? Which is NOT
       Flash’s thing.
       But it might be this guy’s thing…
       [284]https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/d/d8/RipHunter.jpg
       As is, both Martha issue and how they barely try to talk before
       they start to whale on each other feels contrived.
       Just like that whole “Wazzup WW. Watch these cool videos.
       Superpeople. LOL” bit which besides feeling contrived and jammed in
       there solely to facilitate future movies – also feels cheap.
       You know… like all those after credits scenes in all those MCU
       movies are contrived and basically teasers for the “next issue”.
       Or how anything Black Widow or Hawkeye related in Avengers 2 feels
       contrived and jammed in there solely cause plot demands it.
       Or like that time when Hulk goes Hulk and fights one of the good
       guys solely so we’d have THAT scene in the movie? What do you mean
       which time?
       On the other hand… There are bits of it that kinda hint that
       somewhere in the whole process a much better film was lost.
       Like that time-traveling stranger. Or the whole Batman and WW
       thing. Or how Jimmie Olsen gets executed like it’s nobody’s
       business. Or how the following testimony about “deaths in the
       village due to Superman” feels a lot like that other testimony
       which turned out to be propaganda.
       [285]https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nayirah_%28testimony%29
       So no… Not bad at all. No worse than Avengers 2… but better than
       Man of Steel.
       Primarily for never really being boring. Which MoS never really
       escapes. Too many talks back at the farm.

       all worked up for Star Trek fans not liking the JJ-Trek movies,
       when he is known to have been a vocal hater of the SW prequels.
       Personally, I don’t care for either “Star” franchise, but
       Trekkers/Trekkies have the right not to like JJ’s movies if they
       feel those movies don’t represent what Star Trek should be.

       Bruce decides to spare one guy LoS brought him only to blow up
       their monastery a minute later resulting in triple digit death
       count…alongisde that one guy he vowed not to kill. I suppose
       there’s an argument to be made about how that only makes the story
       better. He’s a hypocrite but the mere notion of “having your own
       moral code” makes him better then his enemies if not in anyone’s
       else POV then at least for his own peace of mind. It’s humanizing
       and relatable.

       That’s why I’ve put in bald where they deliberately, explicitly and
       openly LIE.
       Feel free to reread my post again.
       I mean, schadenfreude is all nice and entertaining… but this is
       starting to feel not just petty but also stupid.
       It’s one thing to make fun of the movie that flopped for being bad,
       it’s another to make fun of a bad movie that still raked in
       millions.
       That’s not joking – that’s being the joke.
       This shit is turning into people pretending that a bad movie has
       flopped – while it is out there raking in hundreds of millions.
       That’s being either delusional (and in a way that makes Bat-fans
       paragons of sanity with their claims of Snyder’s genius and all) –
       or a cunt.
       Seriously, there’s so much wrong or what could have been done
       better with that movie – and still people need to LIE to make it
       seem faring worse than it does?
       As for Collider… Entire Gawker media hive are the lowest scum-dumps
       of the internet, along with TMZ and similar “you won’t believe what
       happens next” clickbait brigade.
       Their entire business model is based on hyperproduction of
       “articles” which are purposefully inflammatory and sensationalistic
       in order to draw in more clicks.
       You might as well be quoting 4chan – they at least admit they are
       trolls and they are doing the flaming and trolling for free.
       Gawker cunts make the Fappening assholes come off as well behaving
       AND sensible individuals.
       At least they didn’t go on the internet flaunting their own
       invincibility, rejecting the court decisions and disobeying court
       orders.
       Gawker scum are cunts.
       Syphilitic, pus-dripping, rotten, rat-infested, dead-baby-filled

       Okay, seriously:
       WE DON’T SPOIL BB. We just… don’t. Same with The Wire and similar
       shows. Not cool, brah!

       I tried to give it some structure… it’s kinda hard at this point in

       So my “DC friend” said couple of interesting things regarding the
       “Martha twist” and… some more.
       I will share it with you (if we didn’t grow tired of this
       clusterfuck) once I sober up. I just find it hard to believe that
       someone with such high standards regarding movies did enjoy BvS.
       Maybe we are all paid by Marvel, we just don’t know it yet! Oh,
       look, SPIDERMAN!

       I am sorta on verge with this. On a cesspool, sorry, webzone, that
       is known for its assholery, I am kinda OKay with spoilers…. I
       guess?
       But as a TV show fanboi, I know a lot of people gonna dip into that
       pool later than me / us, and they don’t need the best shit ever
       spoiled.
       Am I a hypocrite? Yes. But then again, I am #TeamTony!!!!
     * Wizard Phoenix
       tOmy, you have become infected with Batman-News!
     * tOmy`
       Nah. We don’t spoil TV shows. Especially the couple that matters.
       We should have an embargo on the good shit. I know only two shows I
       don’t want to spoil and this is one of them. People are still
       catching up.
       But I am okay with spoiling Sons of Anarchy. Noone will ever
       believe that shit anyway.

       they MAY have lived.
       Batman MAY be against murder in comics but he sure as fuck causes a
       lot of death in nearly every modern movie.
       It’s just somewhat plausibly maybe not fatal.
       Hey… remember that scene in Captain America 2 where a guy takes a
       building AND a helicarrier in the face – and still makes it?

     * Wizard Phoenix
       At least the product placement was extremely downgraded from Man of
       Steel. That movie and Jurassic World had some of the worst I’ve
       ever seen in a blockbuster.
     * tOmy`
       Now, honestly, you (well I) gave me a pause:
       Do we spoil TV shows here? Like the good ones? The top of the
       cream? Because whenever we talk about them, we are still being
       kinda vague… is it like an automatic reaction? Like the post below…
       that is FAR from real spoilers, because people know how the show
       ends… but…
       How do we people treat it? I am honestly kinda… intrigued. Do we
       leave out the minor amazing things except the big developments
       everyone knows about? Or do we talk about Wallace?
       No, seriously, String, DO WE TALK ABOUT WALLACE?!
     * Hank_Henshaw
       What if the critics were indeed paid off to write horrible reviews,
       only not by Marvel, but by Warner? That way everyone would go in
       expecting the movie to be the worst thing since ebola, but it the
       end it’s just dengue fever-bad.
     * Wizard Phoenix
       I don’t take these TV things seriously but if you do get a life.
     * tOmy`
       Well, you did like BvS.
     * dollar store cashier wife
       tv shows,movies,video gamez,books-whatever. I don’t spoil any piece
       of entertainment/art that I would recommend to another person. As a
       a gay nigger once said: “A Man Got to Have a Code”
     * Wizard Phoenix
       I didn’t love it though.

     * tOmy`
       The gay niggers usually have a point. And something tells me, it
       ain’t about the money.
       No, but still – since I have you here and I am batshit drunk – we
       tread carefully – about spoilers. Why is it? Even the [redacted]
       from Fargo we sorta kept “secret”.
       Do you think we know people will eventually get to that? And why is
       it so different from movie spoilers? Is it because we both believe
       that TV rakws? Or is it because others don’t see it the same way
       and eventually will walk that path and WHERE IS YOUR MR. ROBOT

       Yeah, but when it comes to this long-running stuff?
       I think everyone knows what is the ending. But the “journey being
       the idea” still… somehow works, you know? So the little awesome /
       shocking things? I still feel like these shows deserve to have?
       As in: People know how BB turns out. But I think there is a LOT of
       moments you haven’t seen / you are not familiar with that are
       BATSHIT good. Just like any other good show. Fuck, just like
       Justified.

       I have no idea.I guess for the most part I simply enjoy going into
       these things blind. So I extend that courtesy. I usually don’t even
       watch trailers before my movies or tv shows lol. But I guess it’s
       all fair if you’re talking about something old and classic. I had
       the ending of Twin Peaks spoiled for me before I even knew who
       David Lynch was. Coudn’t really complain about getting a
       universally adored 15 year old show getting spoiled to me.
     * Like Icare
       Hmm… could be. But I sure hope not.
       Cause if that’s where the story is going… All this so far will look
       cheerful and shiny.
       Not that I’m really complaining… but there’s a reason why such
       stories are Elseworlds stories and not the main narrative.
     * tOmy`
       Mr. Robot is a show I don’t even… reference to the… all other
       stuff. You cannot recommend it and draw comparisons without
       eventually breaking it… and at the same time having the laugh about
       how is the show leading you on.
       You just… sorta can’t. And it’s shitty most of my friends missed
       it, just because it is a “hacker drama”.

       I don’t know why this asshole’s movies have to be so grim dark and
       look like tacky fan films with multimillion dollar budgets. It
       would be neat if Warner tried to do a Forever People movie that was

       I’ll tell you what DOES bug me, though, is the assumption that if
       you’re not watching along with a current show then you obviously
       don’t care. I rarely watch shows when they’re current, preferring
       to wait until they’ve ended to hear if the show stayed strong until

       However, the % drop is still troubling, hundreds of millions in
       profits or not. This film was projected to pull in at around the
       mid-to-high 400s globally. That’s expectation. Studio expectation
       doesn’t reflect high hopes, it reflects lower on the scale; not
       quite but close to a minimum. They factor in 3 day drops and 9 day
       drops (weekend-to-weekend).
       Anything less than 1.3 billion will be below what is needed for
       this film to be where it needs to properly feed the franchise.
       That aside, the rest is just, as you said, a bunch of clickbait and
       fan-to-fan bashing.

       are still Marvel shills?

       Just look at these testimonials:
       “CBS force feeding feminist agenda to viewers”
       “97% Really?”
       “Supergirl in not a 5 Star show, it is at most a 1 Star because
       it’s not a
       family show about Supergirl, is mostly about feminism and the evil
       white man. Even if you take all that hateful crap out, it’s only a
       3 at
       most. It is not better than any these movies / TV shows, let alone

       because of the evil feminazi agenda. Gotcha.

       This was, in my opinion, one of the very best HitB episodes in a

       often.

       The Wonder Woman theme was nice but anything else Zimmer did was

       In all fairness, the dreary self-seriousness of this movie mirrors
       the dreary self-seriousness of DC comics. It’s never been the same
       since Identity Crisis in 2004. That was the point of no return.
       They’ve had every chance to unscramble that egg and they’ve always
       doubled down on making their heroes (and readers) miserable. Now,
       it’s bled over into the movies. I hope the Anti-Monitor nukes this
       DC movie universe out of existence.

       Well i just lost interest in keeping up with. After infinite
       Crisis, There was 52, Th Final Crisis, Blackest Night, Flash Point.
       With Marvel it was Civil War, World War Hulk, Secret Invasion, and
       etc etc. They wonder why they cant get new readers. Its because who
       wants to keep up with this crap. Back When Stan Lee was writing
       this stuff. Hay you want to follow Spider-man. Just Read the
       Amazing Spider-man. Every once in the while the character would
       cross each other paths and have adventure together. But they was
       the extent of the Universe. Kinda like how the Movies are now.

       You mean when Mr “Elongated man” wife gets raped and is later
       burned to death. And it was the Atoms wife who burned who killed
       her . So she can be with her Husband again. I mean its not like she
       couldn’t have said. Hey you want to get back together Yeah that
       Story-line was pretty bad.
     * SeanLM
       And after that it just continued (Wonder Woman killing Maxwell
       Lord, Arsenal’s daughter murdered are two more examples) until the
       absolute self parody displayed in the New 52 (Joker cutting his
       face off and then stapling his face back on, Harley Quinn dressing
       like a juggalo/white trash hooker). Of course the DC universe is
       being relaunched/rebooted/whatever again because it failed to put a
       dent in Marvel’s market share. I think the key is that Marvel
       doesn’t hate its own characters. The people who run DC absolutely
       hate some of their characters and it shows.
     * bleurgh
       Lego batman already looks 1000 times better than this pile of

     * Mike Magnum
       Well that kinda of the Problem with DC. They do there best stuff
       when they don’t try to play catch up with Marvel or even try to
       emulate Marvel. But because just like the movies. They really suck
       at it. Image, Dark Horse, IDW and Dynamite have even less Market
       Share than either DC or Marvel. And i Doubt they spend all there
       time trying to one up each other. They just do whatever is
       interested in writing.
     * SeanLM
       I would somewhat disagree with Mike on one point. Yes, you can make
       an unapologetically corny Chris Reeves type Superman movie for
       today’s audiences. Rich pointed out in the MoS review that Supes is
       wish fulfillment for 6 year olds. So let Superman be for young kids
       and make a movie with enough wit and whimsy so that it’s not
       insulting to the adults in the audience. There is now no Superman
       for kids because they are targeting the Kevin Smiths of the world.
       I’d be insane to give my (hypothetical) kid a Superman comic or
       take him/her to this pigshit. Batman can skew older but not
       Superman.
       Oh, and BvS had the largest Friday to Sunday drop of any superhero
       movie, even worse than the recent Fantastic Four. With its B on
       Cinemascore, hopefully it’s going to plunge next week.
     * SeanLM

       Well to tell you the truth. I don’t know what is for kids anymore.
       I know when i was a kids. During Prime Time TV. You could watch a
       man and his talking car goes on Adventures together or a bunch of
       armed mercenary save a town from a corrupt businessman. All while
       never hitting a thing. Or a Guy who can get out of any situation
       with some gum and a knife. Now Time TV is about boring lawyers or
       just Assholes being Assholes. If i was a kid today. I would
       protest.
     * Evertale
       That’s a bit too dramatic for my taste… but hey! That’s more like

       Well, it turns out, movies need more than just aesthetics. Like a
       competently told story, clear character motivations, depth, and
       nuance. Who knew?
     * Nero12
       I think there was a good movie buried somewhere in this kitchen
       sink, but then they bashed superman over the head with it and it
       got dumb.
       The opening action scene of batman navigating Metropolis as it’s
       being burned to a crisp by Superman is especially well done.
       Replace Jesse Eisenberg with anyone else (does no one else find him
       unwatchably awful?), replace Holly Hunter with someone who doesn’t
       look like a country star, and you’ve almost got half a movie. Play
       up the dream sequences and play down the action scenes and maybe
       you’ve got something unique and interesting- but I don’t think
       Afflect would be smart enough to understand that movie.

       It’s funny how some people [on BatmanNews] have been like: “What

       kind of a brilliant masterpiece, other than in terms of

       A quick question. Does the blue ray shoot up into the sky?
     * WrongWithYourFace
       Short and concise. I like that.
     * Buk Pravon
       Well, if you need a deeper grammatical analysis: The syntax is
       correct. The phrase “Komm hier” wouldn’t be used by a german in
       this context. We would say “Komm zu mir” = “Come to me”. And “süße
       Eutern” is the wrong way around: “süßen Euter” would be correct
       because “Euter” is in this case neuter plural, which indicates a
       “-n” at the end of every adjective used to describe it. While
       “Eutern” would only be used if the speaker wants to imply that
       there is something at or near by the udders. “Die Kuh hat ein
       Geschwür an den Eutern.” for example. Means “The cow got an abscess
       at the udders.”
     * WrongWithYourFace
       No, really I just liked the to-the-point answer.
       But I’ll allow it.
     * bleurgh
       Also it helps if the characters in your movie sort of resemble the
       characters they’re supposed to be representing.
     * tOmy`
       Well, my head seems to be functioning again and from what I can
       tell, this is what alive feels like, so let’s go back to the
       discussion from yesterday I don’t remember having:
       So I talked to my BvS friend (yes, I do label them this way from
       now on) and here is couple of things:
       1) Movie desperately needs that R rated cut
       2) Murdering = no; manslaughter = yes
       3) His own take on Martha: Apparently, it is foreshowed from the
       very beginning of the movie. We also understand (or the movie tries
       to make us understand) that Batman views Superman as an alien, a
       non-human like force that threatens the world. Him realizing that
       Superman indeed has mother of his own makes him, in Batman’s eyes,
       an actual human being. Now that ain’t the newest concept around,
       nor it is revolutionary, but it does make some sense. However, I
       still think it would work much better if they had different names,
       because all comic book trivia aside, it does sound like something
       Snyder considers “subtle”.
     * Earth
       It’s amazing that Lex Luthor’s plot in BvS is actually a retelling
       of his evil plan in Superman IV: The Quest for Peace.
       He steals some kind of Superman-like DNA, and creates a Superman
       monster with it.
     * tOmy`
       That Spiderman description sounds like a projection.
     * WrongWithYourFace
       Yes, it’s foreshadowed… by hammering the point home so everyone in
       the audience absolutely knows what Bruce’s mom’s name is. Bruce
       Wayne goes to visit the family crypt and the camera explicitly
       focuses on the name “Martha” on the tombstone. And in the
       beginning, Bruce’s father, The Comedian, goes all Citizen Kane and
       whispers “Martha” in an extreme closeup.
       Wait, did I say “Citzen Kane”? God, this movie was BRILLIANT!
     * dollar store cashier wife

       I hate that whole storyline in this movie so fucking much.
       This shouldn’t have been a “dawn of justice” film, or a [spoilers I
       guess] death of Superman film. This should’ve been the DCEU’s
       Batman standalone film with direct tie-ins to Man of Steel; the
       appearance of Superman, the arrival of Zod, and the destruction
       that followed, which, to me, was the best part of the film. All of
       that should’ve been the inciting incident that pulled this older
       Batman out retirement in the first act.
       The rest of the film should’ve been Batman prepping for the
       takedown of a god and the twist, that both of them are being played
       by a third party
       .

     * dollar store cashier wife
       In Man of Steel, there’s a dramatic pan out in one shot as Superman
       makes out with Lois Lane in ground zero of the burning ruin that
       was once Metropolis. Certainly, tens of thousands of people lie
       dead beneath the scattered rubble, and thousands more are buried in
       the dark, choking on dust, pinned by steel girders, pierced by
       rebar, screaming out for someone to find them, to at least remove a
       slab of concrete that they might see the sun before they die.
       Certainly there are children, children whose breath is constrained
       by the weight of their dead parents, children who have no concept
       of what to do in the dark that stinks of the mortar dust and copper
       blood, no concept but to sob uncontrollably.
       But for Zack Snyder, to show Superman saving someone like that
       would imply the existence of hope. And that is one thing Snyder
       can’t abide, not in Man of Steel, and certainly not in this movie.
       Any minor detail that would make it seem as though life is not
       cheap, as though heroes exist, must be excised, and has been. It is
       a masterwork of brutal efficiency. For Snyder, hope is a curse, and
       we will be glad of its absence when we die meaninglessly, gasping.

       Well, that is certainly one way to look at it, but not necessarily
       the correct one.
       There is a difference between these two fields; psychiatrists are
       physician specialists, psychology is a behavioral study. There is
       also a big difference between therapy and treatment, or behavioral
       problems and mental disorders.
       Psychologists also work with communities, schools, in workplaces
       and many other places, where psychiatrists are not needed.

       Finally getting caught up on the Walking Dead. Can anyone who has

       This is what they call Walking Dead writing. If it’s dumb as shit,

       Well, since we are on the topic of TV shows: Black Sails Season 3
       (Starz)
       Fuck you, show. I have been waiting for two long years for this
       Bay-driven pirate excess to start inevitable sucking and yet here
       we are again, pondering upon whether this is still some streak of a
       luck or actually competent show. We started with mildly
       interesting, plot driven excess of boobs and vaginas, by the ending
       of the second season we got to use the words “balls to the wall
       awesome” and now the word “smart” started creeping into the
       conversation, like an uninvited guest in the Transformers universe.
       This show dodged so many bullets that it’s starting to remind me of
       Ali G. The cock included.
       From the intriguing opening episodes, through the bumpy ride in the
       middle, to scarily bold panultimate episode and kinda phenomenal
       finale, this show refuses to die as hard as them Chernobyl
       survivors. So hear hear, raise the colors high and all aboard the
       hype ship, because we yet again reached the point where we have to
       admit that despite its many flaws, this show is still kinda
       awesome. 8/10

       delighting his target audience – drunken man children. From the

       mystery is made all the more tantalizing with a sudden appearance
       by a Transformer’s reference. The second act, which involves
       Chernobyl, is certain to leave you begging for more. But the ending
       fell a little flat for me. Still, this reviewer is eager for more.

       and then laugh about it afterwards. Actually, that’s not true,
       because Negan is totally against sex crime stuff. He thinks it’s

       “I loved his Batman… that fight scene was like right out of an

       hit it just made him more angry and he just took it out on the next

       “In an alternate universe where Bruce was the one who died and his
       father was the one who became Batman, Bruce’s mothers was the
       Joker. Of course this was no meaning in the other universes.”
       This sounds like a mission for Snyder.

       “There’s a really neat theory where it says Batman traveled to the
       past to kill his own parents in that alley so he becomes Batman in
       the future to prevent all the horrible future things from
       happening. That drove future Batman crazy and ultimetly turned him
       into Joker, while young Bruce then grew up to be Batman.”

       about them and just expect people to be happy.

       (Justice League). And the movie was released in Easter!
       It’s just what the two jewish guys that invented the character had
       envisioned, all the way back in 1938.
       Just like Spielberg loves every time people say E.T. is a Jesus
       allegory.
       (Note: I’m not jewish, but leave religion out of superhero movies).

       Seriously though, why is Superman so miserable in these movies?

       I’ll play the devil’s advocate in here: that honestly does not
       apply to comicbooks. Even within a single continuity you get
       characters changing quite a bit due to different writers coming in.
       Yes, you do have “rules” like no killing for B n’ S, but I honestly
       do not have a problem with that changing as well if the rest moves
       in that direction accordingly (which it kinda does). I think the
       whole “this is not how it’s supposed to be” debate detracts from a
       more meaningful discussion of what does and does not work in the
       movie.
       I’m also not saying I’m immune to this. God (heh) knows I will be
       an insufferable prick when it comes to the Preacher adaptation.
     * Earth
       And that’s why I’m not a fan of comic books, because there is such
       a fucked attitude to characters. You can do whatever you want TO
       characters, but they shouldn’t be constantly changed to suit
       whatever new writer’s ideas. If they want a new character, invent a
       new character. Don’t fuck with the pre-established.

       Speaking about motivations and characters of superheros:
       “Made by MCU Exchange, this video collects footage from most of the
       Marvel movies (sadly, no Guardians Of The Galaxy or Ant-Man
       footage), including moments from Agents Of S.H.I.E.L.D. and Jessica
       Jones to outline the beginnings of the central feud in the latest
       Captain America film.”

       You are correct. Movies can’t be, and never are, 100% like the
       comics. Not even the animated series are 100% like the comics.
       Different mediums. Yet, there are ways to adapt things in such a
       fashion that the core of the characters is maintained, or is done
       in a way where the vast majority of people is able to embrace the
       changes. There’s also the problem that changing Batman, Superman or
       Spider-Man is a bigger deal than changing Hank Pym or Nick Fury.

       I’d say that if you’re going to make an adaptation like a big movie
       that’s going to set the standards of public perception for a
       character, you’d want to depict them at their best and most
       “classic”; essentially a distilled version of why so many people
       like the character and what’s made them endure for decades.
       I’ve heard people try to argue that films like MoS work if you
       treat them like an “Elseworlds” story, but that shouldn’t be the
       kind of film you build a universe around that’s supposed to be the

       Except for all those people who loved it when it was originally
       released… I didn’t have to personally hear anything, I personally
       know some. I don’t think you had to be a 10 year old in 1977 to
       find enjoyment in Star Wars.

       Truly great genre movies will attract people of all ages. That’s my

       what about PT?
     * Toffoli_73
       Enjoying the PT and thinking they are good films are two different
       things.
     * Tapeworm
       Yes. And going after this or that demographic really doesn’t help
       the artistic side of things.
     * dollar store cashier wife
       I feel like OT is for all ages even though ROTJ really strays into
       Prequel territory. Prequels themselfs are for children no matter
       how much George wants to pretend he made a complex political drama.
     * Domo
       Yep, but Star Wars has the added hassles of edited versions and
       prequels that other franchises don’t quite have. If you watch the
       prequels first, it really dampens the appeal of the OT. Which made
       me like TFA more; it felt like a desperately needed reset for
       people who didn’t get to enjoy the film the way other fans have.
     * Tapeworm
       High five, Disney Sistah!
     * Toffoli_73
       You saw the prequels first? Oh man, that’s just not the way to do
       Star Wars.
       You watch the PT first when you should have watched the OT, you’re
       gonna have a bad time.

       Here’s an useless discussion I wanna hear: There is a difference
       between a review and a deep analysis. Lots of people go “Oh, you so
       stupid, in the scene where..and in the scene where..and if you
       remember in the first movie…”
       A critic is supposed to be knowledgeable about the craft generally,
       but he has no obligation to become an expert on the ins and outs of
       a specific film he gives his impressions of.
     * Mike Magnum
       Anyone think the Dream Sequence could have made for an interesting
       movie. I mean replace Batman and Superman with Generic characters.
       Get a Decent Writer and Director. You might have something.
     * Domo
       At the time, though, it seemed like a good idea. Phantom Menace was
       premiering in the theaters, and fellow fans thought “Hey! You get
       to see it the way it’s supposed to. How great is that?!” Little did
       I know at the time that it would completely turn me off to the
       franchise for the better part of a decade.
     * Toffoli_73
       I’m a big fan of scenes making sense in the context of the movie
       they take place in.
     * Toffoli_73
       Happens so often now. They get lost in making the movie as epic and
       grand as possible, they miss an opportunity to tell a far more
       interesting story hidden within.
     * Tapeworm
       Check out the comicbook series Irredeemable. It’s about 40 issues,
       no continuity bullshit and manages to explore the “What if Superman
       was evil” thing better than anything else.
     * dollar store cashier wife
       You need to show you actually understand the material in question
       on a basic level at least. Mick&Jake actually fail at this quite
       often. Just two months they wrote off The Revenant as meaningless
       even though the movie has simplistic themes and messages that are
       being hammered into you every 10 minutes or so. “It’s just a
       revenge movie” yeah if you’re blind and deaf. Valuable criticism 4
       sho!
     * Sheriff Mitchell
       Because Mark Waid gets it. God damnit.
     * Tapeworm
       Where does that stop though? I’m not defending Mike and Jay’s
       dismissal of some stuff, but if you are giving your opinion, the
       fact that you didn’t get some stuff is a part of that.
       However, yeah, going in without trying to understand, is a problem.

       “I especially don’t like the idea of a version of Superman that is

       That simply is not who Superman should be. Anyone who thinks it is,
       well, they shouldn’t be making Superman movies.”

       then.

       I grew up in the 90’s so I had already been immersed in the OT but
       was still a kid when the PT started. Star Wars all came at me at
       once over the span of 5 years or so. I didn’t have 20 years of
       nostalgia built up but even I could tell that the PT was a sad,
       cringe-worthy shell of the OT.
     * dollar store cashier wife
       Right. Being open-minded is quintessential when it comes to

       So they had the Notorious Z.O.D. Mark Luthorberg, Rock Monster, The
       Joker is in the Will Smith movie…Justice League is gonna be
       Brainiac, right? They don’t have more imagination than that.
     * Toffoli_73
       I had a thought. TFA is a well executed movie with hardly any
       ambition. BvS is trying to be ambitious (kinda) with hardly any
       idea of how to execute it. Maybe Snyder and Abrams combined would
       counter each others’ weaknesses and create something truly worth
       while.
     * Tapeworm

     * Palpatine

       movie too kid friendly sounding.

       keep his politics in his pocket.

       There are rumors they may go with Vandal Savage. I’m not sure
       Vandal Savage has enough of a cinematic presence to be the main bad

     * Toffoli_73
       Yeah I realize that Bird’s movie politics boils down to “we need
       the elite and powerful to save us from ourselves”. Very Randian.
     * tOmy`
       Is that his actual name?
     * Earth
       I give credit to Bird that the Objectivist stuff in Tomorrowland is
       really just saying that people should strive to be exceptional, but
       it still has that creepy, “us specials need a safe haven to escape
       the mediocre normals who hold us back”-vibe.
       Bird’s stuff is always Rand-lite I guess, which I’m ok with, but if
       anything Tomorrowland was just too whiney.

       Yeeees it was. My parents had to lock me in my room when it came

       knew I their 7 yr old son would love it, BECAUSE they thought I
       could handle the adult content, that and I loved horror and sci
       -fi.
       All of those lines around the block were comprised of drug addled
       young adults and 30 somethings. After that the kids started lining
       up because the parents had to see it again and it was permissible
       for a younger audience, because of lack of nudity and profanity,
       which back then was normal for “adult” movies.

       Opress, General Grievance, Captain Boneto Pick, etc.
     * OMNI
       Yes the prequels were an attempt at a “perfect” adventure movie.
       Which is impossible. Skimping on violence and gore, sexual
       situations and muted characters does not “adult” entertainment
       make. To me “Raiders of the Lost Ark”
       is the perfect adventure movie and it ain’t for little kids, but
       it’s not too vulgar or hardcore, just whimsical adventure.

       Goku is kinda like Superman. An alien super being raised on Earth.

     * Spoiled Ants

       Nah…
       First of all that statistic is meaningless on its own – even
       without going into the whole cherry picking thing Gawker cunts went
       into.
       It’s not a predictor of anything – cause it can’t be.
       It can’t take in account of movies which don’t open on weekends, it
       doesn’t take in account presold tickets, it alters nothing
       regarding the future results (number of theaters, number of days
       movie will be in theater, competition…)… it’s meaningless
       statistic.
       It’s a real life example of information bias – a cognitive bias
       where people want more information even if it is of no use.
       Second… The “size” of the movie is an illusion.
       This is not the DC’s Avengers. It just gets associated to it cause
       we know that it’s about a superhero team – that’s it.
       But there is nothing resolved in the “grand storyline”.
       We don’t even know anything about the “grand storyline”.
       Characters are not yet there even.
       Two new main characters and a new villain are rushed in.
       Only hints are made of some bigger story.
       At best – it’s DC’s Iron Man 2. Second movie.
       If we disregard two Hulks and a Green Lantern. What is it with
       green superheroes?
       It appears to us that the movie is YUUUUUUGEEEE because it has
       flagship characters in it – but it’s only the second movie in the
       series, and two of the main characters didn’t even get their own
       movie yet.
       BTW, it’s budget is only $50 million more than Iron Man 2.
       Which made $623 million, worldwide.
       Even taking all that off the board, if we imagine a situation where
       DC and WB are completely broke and bankrupt… these are money in the
       bank IPs.
       Remember how Terminator franchise, which is peanuts compared to
       Superman or Batman, got sold off cause its owners got bankrupted?
       Two years later, after two years of bids and deals falling through,
       rights are sold and the next movie starts preproduction a year
       later.
       And they were aiming at a trilogy even before they made the first
       movie.
       There’s simply too much money to be made from these IPs in deals
       and merch for a little thing like the movie flopping or
       underperforming to matter.
       Hell… Fucking Hulk movies still sold toys.
       And if we’ve learned anything from TFA – movie itself doesn’t
       matter one bit as long as it is a collection of “things we
       recognize” and there is enough advertizement for it.
       People will pay to watch shit like Paul Blarp 2.
       Just let them know that it is a YUUUUUGEEEE movie – they will go
       and see it if is available.
       I.e. If there are enough theaters showing it. And if enough ads
       tell them to go and buy a ticket.
       Those are the only important stats.
       How many theaters and how much was spent on advertising.
       And even the second one doesn’t really matter that much – if you
       can stir up the buzz about the movie in the media.
       Like by putting a black stormtrooper in the teaser, front and
       center, thus creating the whole “haters are racist and sexist”
       narrative, which then continued to resonate through the media –
       completely free and gratis.
       We are in the age when Imaginary Properties are simply too big to
       ever fail.
       As long as you can stoke up any interest – someone will pay to see
       that.
       7 billion humans out there. Over 3 billion are online.
       Make some shit that only 1 in 100 will like and that’s 70 million
       fans, 30 million of which will instantly become aware of your
       product if you know how to sell it right.
       Make some mediocre, lowest common denominator shit, but get
       everyone to know about it… well… how much did TFA make again?

       problems with the show but I still managed to enjoy it. Maybe I’ll
       review or talk about it some day but I’ll just leave a score for
       now. 4.5/10 for the new season (4 is bad, 6 is good and 5 is

       So, the Kents raised Superman to be an objectivist or a really flat
       thinking Nietzscheanist. He only has himself. He knows he’s better
       than anyone and he shows contempt to anyone below him. Whatever
       help he brings to people is because he only realizes that he needs
       the powerless sheep to stay in power. What good is power for when
       you have no one to rule? Of course, a good Nietzscheanist would say
       “the power to rule yourself” but that would be too smart for
       Snyder. He also probably hasn’t heard pf virtue ethics that’s back
       en vogue and actually fits his modern gods take on things.

       Shooter Jennings – Countach for Giorgo
       Already labeled as the strangest country album of the year, the
       southern outlaw singer-songwriter brings 9 new songs that are as
       close to country as Mercury is to Earth. Sounding more like
       Chemical Brothers catalogue, spotting the country standards in the
       wave of electronica and psychadelia is kinda fun, because it is
       rather unique and definitely deserves praise. And there is also
       pretty fucking great duet with Marilyn Manson. 8/10
       Parov Stelar – Live Pukkelpop
       Are we the only country that is still holed up in this
       electro-swing nonsense? Parov is coming here like twice a year and
       while the shows are kinda worth seeing, just hearing them is a
       snooze. Parov is definitely live act first, producer second and
       person who you should care about eight. 5/10
       Zomboy – Neon Grave
       Look, Zomboy, this is an intervention. We, the collective hivemind
       of listeners, already ruled dubstep / brostep dead and send it off
       back to underground, where it belongs with people creating
       atmosphere rather than noise. Unfortunately, Zomboy doesn’t seem to
       care or understand, so this aptly titled album features 6 boring
       dubstep songs and the only innovative thing being spicing them up
       with trap (another genre that should follow dubstep back into the
       void) as to somehow try to recapture the lighting in the bottle
       that is the annoying Lean On single. Well… better luck next time.

       sense of humour. To be fair Mike seems to like that sort of thing
       too. Honestly it just depends on whether it’s a clusterfuck or not.

     * Like Icare
       That “But it actually cost XXX dollars” tide lifts all yachts.
       It’s just that it is not in vogue to look into “Hollywood
       accounting” done by Disney – though they are certainly doing the
       same inflating of their overhead costs on their movies as WB is
       doing with their own.
       We know they are not guided in their accounting and profit seeking
       by anything even remotely like morals.
       And since we’re comparing “movie products” by giant corporations
       and not small independent productions… for every “But it actually
       costs…” we’d have to apply the same formula to the movies it is
       being compared to.
       Besides that… it is a well known “fact” that Harry Potter movies,
       Star Wars movies, Spider-man movies, Lord of the Rings movies…
       never made profit.
       Which we know because of lawsuits.
       From which we know that it is not a chase into land of milk and
       money – it’s a never-ending ride.
       And all the yachts get pushed by the same winds of profit and
       raised by the same tide of fraudulent accounting.

       Whatever happened to the guy who directed 300 and The Dawn of the
       Dead remake? I want that guy back. Those were legitimately good
       movies. Someone take Zack Snyder’s budget away from him. Or maybe
       just stop letting him make superhero movies. He has not made a
       single decent one. The only one that was half-decent was Watchmen.
       And there was just too much weirdness/bad acting in that movie to
       consider it good. Zack Snyder has had 10 long years of mediocrity.
       Either kill him or fix him, I don’t care which.

       things just because.

       from behind their cloaks, at which point they can be burned out
       with regular X-ray lasers.
       So Obama urgently needed some of those nukes Castro told McNamara
       about.
       Still, it was just in the nick of time.

       The bad news is… those were the last ones. Unless Russia has some

       But if it is……..fun………..(DC executive throws up), then any minor
       plot holes or dumb character decisions can be ignored, because from
       the trailer it looks like unapologetic schlock, which I’m ok with.

       The Russo’s confirmed there’s going to be a mix of 67 heroes &
       villains in the upcoming Infinity War film(s), and have stated that
       there’s a single storyboard panel that promises all 67 onscreen at
       once.

       Watchmen are fantastic book. There is a lot of good comic book
       stuff out there. It’s a form of an art just like any other, except
       for pop-rock.
       There is dumb shit, there is fanboy shit, there is smart shit… I am
       not sure whether 4 year old would understand Sandman, for example.
       Or if they would make it through Hellblazer. And that’s just the
       “classic” stuff, there are some amazing pieces out there.

     * Toffoli_73
       Burton was one of my favorite directors up until about the early
       2000’s. Then he started falling in love with terrible CGI that
       undermined the aesthetic touch I enjoyed in his earlier stuff. Also
       not nearly as much violence.
     * Jonah Falcon
       And then there’s the dreck called Sucker Punch. Very appropriate
       name, too. I think Batman v Superman was supposed to be a sequel.
     * Jonah Falcon
       Who wants to see a Plinkett review of Batman v Superman? Raise your
       hand.
     * fred
       No comment.
       (which is in itself a comment– THE HYPOCRISY)
     * fred
       Why? Not many people knew why Prequels were garbage, that’s what
       made the Plinkett reviews great. Everything’s been said about
       “Bleeeed v. Hypocrite” already.
     * Sheriff Mitchell
       Everything that could possibly be said about this film’s badness is
       being said.
       It’d be like beating a dead horse. I prefer Plinkett reviews on
       divisive films.
     * Toffoli_73
       I think people did know why the prequels sucked but no one had
       bothered to sit down and put it all in a few concise reviews. They
       confirmed what a lot of people had already known.
     * Toffoli_73
       This could still be considered divisive. There are kids who still
       claim that this movie will be loved in 10 years.
     * fred
       Like “Black Spring Break”.
     * Sheriff Mitchell
       Or Blacula.

       Titanic was claimed to be the best movie ever and Plinkett was like

       spend 11$ and 2 hours on it.

       I’ve heard some people comparing it to Blade Runner in that it

     * tOmy`
       Isn’t clopping masturbation to MLP? How can masturbation be an art
       form?
       Or does clopping mean “MLP porn” in general?
     * tOmy`
       Meh, I started reading and see him / her bashing it. I don’t need
       this negativity in my life, goddammit!
     * Percy Gryce
       It’s shtick. Plus everybody bashed it: it was Tarantino’s
       worst-reviewed movie.
       But read on: Ace has noticed some interesting things.
     * Tapeworm
       They both suck, Sonic fanfiction is where it’s at.
     * NicCagesHair
       Between the score(directly from the Thing) and the setting, it’s
       fair to say Tarantino watched The Thing a lot during the creation
       of Hateful.
     * tOmy`
       I actually saw it like two days ago (personally I have no problem
       with the movie) so I did read up on that whole The Thing parallel.
       Someone actually mentioned it couple of days back, which made me…
       buy… the movie, as I kinda forgot that the bluray version might be
       already available for… buying.
     * Toffoli_73
       I didn’t even have to look at the link to realize what was similar
       about the two movies. It makes sense.
     * Tapeworm
       Wait, wait. Are you saying Tarantino has used someone else’s film
       as a template for his? WHAAAAAT?!
     * NicCagesHair
       He would never!
     * Toffoli_73
       The Thing might be my favorite horror film ever so any extra
       attention it gets I’m fine with.

       If I take your meaning of “buy” correctly, somewhere Lars Ulrich is
       crying himself to sleep.
     * Percy Gryce
       Of course, that’s his M.O. But what’s interesting is that he turned
       a sci-fi, horror movie into a Western.
       Kind of like how John Carpenter, in Big Trouble in Little China
       (the third installment in the Carpenter-Russell trilogy), turned a
       Western into a supernatural chop-socky flick.
     * Tapeworm
       Yeah, I mean, I totally watch it as a demo, so I can then buy it
       for realz, right?
     * Palpatine
       The only thing it was missing was a crazy Wilford Brimly.
     * Tapeworm
       I don’t mean to be a smartass about it, but it would be more

       That was the movie that solidified to me that Snyder isn’t a

       There is a certain part of Death Proof that could be a rom com

       You know, before all the carnage.
     * NicCagesHair
       I think the issue is that the first half is slow and does a lot of
       repeating itself. They really try to establish a world where these
       characters all have heard of one another but it ends up in several
       back to back scenes all with the same purpose.
       The middle/mystery part is fantastic and I actually would have
       liked to see more of a mystery/whodunit aspect in the movie.

       I mentioned it in my amazing review, but hey: I was kinda worried
       that the beginning will eventually become boring (all the world
       building and setups and backstories), but as I was on the verge of
       saying: “Well, enough of this.” the movie did exactly that.
       So for me, no probs.

       Just saw BvS, didn’t even dislike it. It’s nothing special but I
       found it entertaining. Though I have to admit I am (anti?) biased,
       because don’t give a rats ass about Superman or Batman breaking
       their own rules on not killing anyone because I’m not a fan of the
       comics.
       I would have probably enjoyed the movie even more if Superman just
       started randomly murdering people on the street by punching them in
       the face or melting them with his laser eyes.

     * Tapeworm
       I dunno, I don’t claim to be a QT expert and I do happen to like
       most of his movies, but since Kill Bill 2 he seems to be married to
       the western aesthetic mixed with the intentionally crappy 70s
       grindhouse cinemaic style. And that goes for stuff like Inglorious
       Basterds as well.
     * VvdD
       But they CAN travel through…… THE PLANET COOOREE!
     * Snake Squeezer
       People who think the movie is in the bottom 10% of the worst they
       have ever seen are just as wrong as the people who think it’s in
       the top 10%.
     * VvdD
       That seems like a fair assessment, and I think that logic applies
       to more movies.
     * Sheriff Mitchell
       My dislike of the film has basically nothing to do with Batman
       killing people.
       It’s just a mess. I admit there’s a few good scenes, but in a film
       that lasts an eternity, it’s hard to enjoy anything about it that
       actually works.
     * Snake Squeezer
       Actually I found out The Planet Core is just a disco that Drinking
       Gin and Lil’ Vader like to go to when they want to blow off some

       Oh I can definitely see where it’s problems lie, but because I am
       completely not invested in the story, (I mean come on Batman facing
       Superman, how is this even a thing?) I just focused on the action
       alone. Which is there, and is decent enough to warrant a ticket in
       this dry spell.

       It’s just too smart for you, dude. Lol.
     * Sheriff Mitchell
       See, I was even a little disappointed with the fight on a visceral
       level. I did love the kitchen sink. I could watch that shit on
       repeat. But I was hoping for more visual variety than just “Batman
       hits him with gas, punches him three times.” It was like a Zelda
       boss fight.
       Batman and Superman have more tricks up their sleeves than jabs and
       crosses.
     * VvdD
       That’s true, I expected more cleverness from Batman, because that’s
       apparently his forte. Instead of just, I made suit to match your
       strength AKA hulkbuster.

     * Gobshite
       The only thing I really found that worked and was enjoyable about
       this film was where Batman fights all the goons in the warehouse.
       It’s literally the only thing that was really well done. Honestly,
       Joel Shuemacher’s efforts were better. That’s a statement in
       itself.

       The book that was supposed to be Batman vs. Al-Qaeda? No I have

       is as wrong as my spelling.
     * junkevil
       You’re better off not playing it because it was terrible.
     * Wizard Phoenix
       Yes. Miller wanted Batman to go the middle east and kill Al-Qaeda
       terrurists. DC wouldn’t let them do that at all so he renamed as
       the Fixer.
     * Wizard Phoenix
       On PC.
     * Sheriff Mitchell
       Oh I know the story, I just never read it. I kind of swore off

       Oh, the one when Batman looks like a sad bunny at the end?

       He’s done nothing of real value for years. Sure.
       But his work on Daredevil and Batman – both of which are as
       influential today as they were 30 years ago – are of more value
       than anything Snyder has put his name on. And Snyder’s best film
       wouldn’t exist without him.

       I actually kinda enjoy it; as I said, I am a fan of mad story done
       in a mad way about music.
       But this just reeks of style over substance. It’s so… pointless.
       The execution, the musical numbers, all of that is fine. Plus I am
       a big fan of Bobby Cannavale. But I have no clue what is the show
       supposed to be about.
       We have the BE actors and writers, yet the crime story is… nowhere
       to be found. So is it about the addiction? About the music
       industry? About the label? About art? Or is it an exploration of
       excess (would explain Scorsese’s name attached to it)?
       I mean… it’s all of that, but in the end, not quite about anything
       out of that. I’d still give it a passing mark. Like… cautions 7/10.
     * dollar store cashier wife
       It’s about a self destructing asshole who lives a life of excess.
       Basically Wolf of Wall Street stretched out into a tv show. I’d
       probably get bored with it really fast on a binge watch but once
       per week it’s kinda fun to get a dose of good music and seeing the
       downward spiral continue for the characters.
     * Thanatos2k
       The thing is, Ant Man is definitely more obscure, but most people
       know of Aquaman – and actively dislike him. So why would they ever
       feature him in anything? With Ant Man, people just didn’t know him,
       they didn’t like or dislike him so the movie could actually
       introduce him to you.
     * tOmy`
       I agree with that.
       I mean, the scenes themselves range from pretty good to fucking
       great, it’s just the whole thread doesn’t quite add up… for me. The
       execution itself is pretty awesome as well.
       But I just feel like it’s missing something. I really liked the
       building crumbling down in the pilot, no matter how cheap it
       looked. It add the flavor of “legend”, not so realistic portrayal I
       kinda dig. But Terrence is playing it safe. He could rewrite a bit
       of a history, you know, do something equally eccentric.
       Don’t get me wrong, most of my fav music movies are style over
       substance as well, but they always had something on top of it. Like
       an additional idea to make it even more cray cray. Velvet Goldmine
       had that whole surreal vibe going (+ followed Citizen Kane, for
       some reason), It’s All Gone Pete Tong is a mockumentary and 24 Hour
       Party People was also more concerned with the legend (+ 4th wall
       breaking).
       You know… something more. I dunno.

       The gist is that the US government wants all the supers to sign up
       to a registry, with the ultimate goal of making them a legitimate
       civil service rather than a bunch of rogues. Or maybe to kill and
       imprison them all, depending on which side you’re on and how
       suspicious you are about the governments motivations.
       Iron Man sees this as them all being held accountable, because a
       bunch of lame-ass, weak and incompetent supers took on someone far
       more powerful than them who ended up blowing up and killing a bunch
       of school-children in the process. If they work for the government
       their actions will be scrutinised and weak supers won’t get work or
       something. The graphic novel is never very clear about the details,
       which is one of it’s major problems.
       Cap thinks supers should continue to be able to operate
       independently, because MURICA and FREEDOM.

       Well, I just watched a video titled “Why Bronies Clop”, or to put
       it in layman’s term: “Why are these idiots masturbating to MLP porn
       images”.
       According to this fella, while you are watching this show, you
       develop certain emotional connection (subtle / strong) to these
       characters, as they appear to be female, act all human-like and
       share our facial expressions.
       “And as far as sexual attraction goes, this is all that is
       necessary.” Also something about emotions being stronger than
       logic; as in: we all know we masturbate to a bunch of cartoon
       unicorns, but hey, what you gonna do about it?
       But the porn itself apparently makes them all more female like,
       including “crotch, breasts and genitalia”, as seen on female
       species (allegedly).
       The guy also states that the most of the fandom suffers from a lack
       of social skills, are needy…
       Yea, so pretty much bunch of maladjusted manchilds fucking ponies.

       I mean shit, people can watch what they want, same as they can be
       punk, emo, metal or goth. I have no problem with that. But as with
       everything, there is a percentage of people who are into it for all
       the scary reasons.
       EMO was always the best example of this shit. It’s all fun and
       games till you realize that like 10% of them are in serious
       trouble.
     * Like Icare
       Ah well… that would be another bowl of balls.
       But there is again the element of adaptation in there.
       Snyder made a pretty detailed and correct adaptation of Watchmen –
       but he missed the point of the original, thus creating a work true
       to the original material in fact but false in form.
       Amazingly, so did all the people who made Before Watchmen.
       Apart maybe for Len Wein. But then again he had the easiest job of
       all on that project.

       I’m inclined to say no, because this was largely in production
       before Deadpool came out. Rather this is a result of WB doubling
       down on Nolan’s brand of dark, realistic superhero mythos reboot.
       With Zach Snyder pulled in to try and create a DC version of
       Watchmen without the benefit of any source material appropriate for
       such a retread or a director and writer team that could deliver
       such fare on their own.
       Instead it comes off as a poem about breasts writ by an illiterate

       Nah… It’s the same shit as with TDKR, Iron Man 3 and Avengers 2.

       It’s gonna go over $700-800 mill worldwide without even trying.
       It will probably go over billion+ worldwide.
       These movies stay in play for nearly half a year. And everyone will
       go watch another Batman moopie.
       Question is – will it beat Iron Man 3 and by how much?
       Actual issue is – where is this going?
       Lighthearted Donner Superman movies start teaming up Supes with a
       comedian and ended up with a retarded final chapter.
       Kooky and campy Tim Burton Batman movies grow more and more campy
       until they are Batman and Robin showing nipples and ass-shots to
       the audience.
       Nolan made progressively bleaker and more current and realistic
       threats which kept being grafted onto more and more unrealistic (in
       comparison) comicbook plots.
       From fighting ninja terrorists armed with fear toxins (seemingly
       realistic, but actually all comicbook), to fighting a psycho clown
       domestic terrorist armed with explosives and working for the mob
       (somewhat realistic on one end – comicbook material on the other) –
       to fighting foreign terrorist armed with nuclear weapons while
       actually being a splinter cell split off of the ninja terrorist
       organization from the first movie (hard realism on one side – heavy
       comicbook nonsense on the other).
       Remember how there was no such thing as kryptonite? How it was
       “kryptonian atmosphere” that got Superman sick?
       Remember how the main villain was a compelling and even tragic
       figure?
       [776]https://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_detailpage&v=0WYg
       u6Xa-_U#t=18
       Remember how there was ONE hero facing off the literal end of the
       world?
       Remember how everything was bleak and… oh, wait… it still is.
       Hopefully, rumors about Suicide Squad reshoots are true and future
       installments will be somewhat less bleak to balance it out with
       things getting more comicbookish in other respects.
       If not…
       Well… When was The Day The Clown Cried supposed to come out?
       WB should pay attention to that date so it doesn’t take up too much
       thunder from their story about people in funny suits and holocaust.
       Oh… wait…

       That’s only because you actually had hope it would be good. If you
       have no hope that something will be good, it can’t be a

     * Palpatine
       I’m enjoying Iron Man so far.
     * Sully
       Are you going chronological or linear order?
     * [781]instant relief
       Yeah, it’s a fun ride for the most part. The villain may be its
       weakest aspect.
     * [782]instant relief
       NEEEERRRDDD!!!!!!!
       Good question tho.
     * Palpatine
       Linear.
     * Sully
       Yeah, it doesn’t really matter since Marvel does a decent job of
       making sure the stories tie-in well together, but there is a
       timeline mix up in phase 1.
     * Like Icare
       The thing is… it’s easy to read that book and completely miss its
       satirical aspect.
       Like with Robocop or Starship Troopers or Total Recall.
       And their remakes and sequels.
       Book is making fun of the superhero genre, portraying them all (and
       in extension the entire genre) as sexual deviants, fascists,
       psychos, bullies… mentally ill to put it short.
       Same goes for the world, tethering on the brink of nuclear
       holocaust.
       Snyder missed all that.
       So all the scenes and the text is there – but the movie thinks that
       (SPOILERS!) Rorschach’s death is tragic and that second Nightowl is
       cool and not a bad pairing for second Silk Specter.
       And other subtle touches.
     * Wizard Phoenix
       So you want my friend to kill Trump to get the attention of an
       actor?
     * tOmy`
       I was thinking about you today, as I was releasing my hounds after
       this particularly foxy lady:
       Have you seen all of the MCU viewing order? As in Agent Carter and
       Agents of SHIELD?
       Any bet on how well the Damage Control TV show will pan out?
       Because that sounds honestly hysterical.
     * Like Icare
       That’s a plan too.
     * Sully
       I watched a little of Agent Carter and the first season of
       S.H.I.E.L.D. on Netflix, but I haven’t kept up.
       Damage Control (the DCEU? I haven’t been keeping up) isn’t really
       connected to the film universe is it? At this point their best bet
       is a safe distance apart.
     * Sully
       Probably for the best. That’ll save on a shit ton of pausing,
       putting in a new movie, skipping ahead, etc.
     * tOmy`
       Nope, it’s this:
       [783]https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Damage_Control_(comics)
       And yes, the TV show is already scheduled, apparently.
     * [784]Bagg of Stool
       That and the whole War on Terror thing. It made me cringe. A lot.
     * Wizard Phoenix
       Don’t forget about Daredevil.
     * Sully
       I’m not that big a nerd.
     * tOmy`
       Yea, I never heard about this prior to today, but someone posted an
       excel of viewing order, including scheduled releases and TV shows
       and this one caught my eye, so I had to google it.
       It looks tremendously hilarious.
     * TheManHole
       Yeah sorry about that.
     * Wizard Phoenix
       At least Palpy isn’t binging the Arrowverse
     * Sully
       I don’t think everything needs to be a part of the MCU. Next thing
       you know they’ll make a “Beyonder” movie and rule every other

       The first season of Arrow is what you get if you force Batman
       Begins to butt fuck Lost at gunpoint, and then force that love
       child to skip acting school… also at gunpoint.
       The second season is what you get if you force The Dark Knight
       Rises to butt fuck Lost at gunpoint, and the force that love child
       to skip acting class, but you at least give it an allowance.

       The main problem with World War Z is that during the principle

       Z’.

       I saw BvS Tuesday night. Thankfully I only spent $3 on a ticket.
       It’s one thing to have a seriously flawed film. It’s another thing
       to make it god-awful boring. BvS was heaps of both. It failed at
       even some of the most basic of narrative storytelling principles
       with regards to film. How can so much talent be wasted on such a
       film?
       I’d say it’s a 2-3/10. #Rough #SnyderSucks

       Pre-Rec vid, Taco. Where’s your tardy note?
     * Wizard Phoenix
       And why isn’t his review long like ours?
     * Mitchell Taco Nash
       It won’t beat Iron Man 3. Not domestically, not overseas, and not
       worldwide. It might even fail to cross $1B worldwide, and if it
       does it will be limping across.
       My first sentence is by far my stronger stance, though. It’s $1B
       chances are more up-in-the-air since overseas audiences are harder
       to predict. They also gave Trans4mers $860M (although China made up
       $320M of that gross).
       Thing is, it’s going to drop hard. It might be hard enough that it
       doesn’t reach $1B even after a $420M opening weekend (although that
       opening weekend included money from Wednesday and Thursday for
       certain territories, but pretty much every film reports those
       grosses as the ‘weekend’ for worldwide opening numbers).
     * Mitchell Taco Nash
       I can almost guarantee a ~70% 2nd weekend drop to $50M. I can feel
       it in my bones!

     * Palpatine
       So Iron Man was a pretty good, phun film. Robert Downey Jr. was
       great as the lead, the action was good, and I thought the story and
       writing worked pretty well. But Jeff Bridges was a lame villian and
       the whole War on Terror thing was kind of annoying.

       your reaction is nearly universal yet the film seems to be a
       financial success.. i can’t figure it out
     * Mitchell Taco Nash
       It’s cause I only seen’t the movie on Tuesday! 🙁
       I could write paragraphs upon paragraphs going into detail as to
       why BvS was a depressing snooze-fest. I just didn’t have the energy
       as I felt everyone here had already written at length so I made
       mine brief.
       Film needed a second unit director to take some establishing shots
       to set up scenes, yo. Also needed some narrative focus. I agree
       with RLM. When watching the film the first hour of scenes can be
       mixed around to the same effect.
       I can’t remember the last time I rolled my eyes so many times
       during a movie I’ve watched in theatres, nor have I said “Whaaat?
       …” or “Oh my god …” or “Really?” so often.

     * Mitchell Taco Nash
       I guess they did get me to pay a ticket.
       With any luck the film drops very hard and barely squeaks a profit
       and the DCEU never really gets off the ground unless Ben Affleck
       somehow saves in with a solo Batman film in the same league as Gone
       Baby Gone, The Town, and Argo (I enjoyed all three).
     * Mitchell Taco Nash
       I thought that movie was gonna stop any momentum IM1 gave the MCU,
       but turns out IM2, Thor, and Cap all did well and then Avengers ate
       up $1.5 billion. I was wrong.
     * junkevil
       That one is actually skippable. It’s only briefly referenced in
       Avengers, and the only character aside from the titular one that
       will come back is General Ross.
     * Sully
       AWESOME! Now take that sentiment to Batman-News, STAT!
       Joking aside, you’d think 3 people with 3 years could’ve come up
       with something a little less… flawed.
     * Mitchell Taco Nash
       Now I’m wondering how many problems stemmed from the script or if
       Snyder just doesn’t know how to tell a story anymore (or if he ever
       really did).
       It’s laughable that people (DC camp in the dumb DC vs Marvel fight)
       were telling supposed Marvel fans that BvS had an Oscar-winning
       writer. Didn’t help …
     * Sully
       Yeah, you could skip that one. I don’t think anything in that film
       other than Thunderbolt Ross will ever be seen in any other MCU
       film. Maybe Abomination. But that’s a big fuckin’ MAYBE.
       That said, I didn’t mind it. Hulk’s design was weird, especially
       after seeing Avengers, but it wasn’t completely off the rails. It
       had its moments.
     * Palpatine
       I know it’s skippable, but since I don’t care for my brain cells,
       I’m gonna watch it anyway.
     * Sully
       I don’t think they have that same detailed 10 year plan that Marvel
       has to keep their shit in line. MoS and BvS both felt like there
       was a goodly amount of winging it going on, and that’s never a good
       idea, especially if you’re trying to thread together 4, 5, 10
       different films into one big story.
     * Paulus Decimus Meridius
       Well you can’t say there’s a single interpretation to the book.
       I’ve just saw the movie and it was not bad. It is true that Snyder
       played it straight, and he changed stuff just because, the ending
       doesn’t work without the squid.
       Well, Rorschach death is tragic but necessary to the story, if only
       Snyder had left out the cheesy sentimental music…
       I hated the music choices btw.

       The forgotten remake is fairly new. Back in the day if Hollywood
       remade something, it was to legitimately try and improve upon it

       subtle.

     * The Elegant Flaw Filial
       So, after seeing the movie (I didn’t pay to see it), I’m under the
       impression that Zak Snyder takes a sociopath-like approach to
       film-making. He’s seen Batman and Superman stories. He can MIMIC
       Batman and Superman stories. But he can’t grasp the emotions of the
       stories or WHY they work the way they do.
       Seriously, if you’re going to make a movie about Batman and
       Superman, you’re making a movie about characters that transcend
       just you. Generations of artists writers have molded these
       characters, offered their takes on them, and come up with
       compelling stories. And yet, Zak Snyder saw Batman and Superman as
       simple empty vessels so he could give the audience pretentious
       diatribes about law and justice. And, suddenly, Batman and Superman
       aren’t characters with certain traits and iron-clad codes… No,
       they’re just sock-puppets and ciphers for Zak Snyder’s “bold,”
       “”philosophical,”” and “”””””””””””””””mature””””””””””””””””
       ideas.
       I know that this is just a popcorn movie and all, but I think the
       way that Hack Snyder treats these characters is gross, cynical,
       ugly and stupid. Not to mention selfish. I know you’re supposed to
       separate the “artist” from the “art,” but I almost hate this guy on
       a personal level.
       Fuck Zak Snyder. Fuck David Goyer. Fuck those stupid, unimaginative
       assholes.

       Naaah… It’s Batman AND Superman. In one movie.
       WHAT A VALUE!!!
       Oh, and Wonder Woman.
       Everyone is already conditioned to go and watch the “new Batman
       movie” just like everyone is going to cinema to see the “new Iron
       Man movie”.
       A decade of training with Nolan movies did that.
       That’s why they are calling what should be Superman 2 – “BATMAN v
       Superman something-something”.
       Higher audience response on the “Which of these superhero movies
       would you like to see next?” question.
       And don’t forget, this is all WEEK 1 – out of ~20.
       At this point it has about $530 million in the bank.
       Which means it needs about 27 million per week, on average, or
       about 4 million daily for it to pass the billion mark.
       And the average movie goer doesn’t give a fuck about feuds or
       franchises – as long as it’s a big and new movie and he/she sees
       things he/she recognizes.
       There are even people out there who actively AVOID knowing anything
       about the movie before they see it. Studios LOVE them.
       Cause those are the same people who will gladly pay extra for 3D.
       Because VALUE!!!
       Oh… and don’t forget. There’s no competition for two more weeks.
       And then – it’s Jungle Book. Vs Batman.
       THEN… it’s Thor and the Midgets. Which everyone is clearly dying to
       see.
       All the way until Civil War in May.
       5 weeks of no competition. Followed by ~13 more weeks after that.

       In this case it’s not interpretation – it’s intention.
       Again – like with Verhoeven movies.
       There’s an action movie people may instantly like or dislike – and
       then there’s the entire satirical undertone one needs to “get” to
       fully understand that the author is fucking with the genre,
       society, audience…
       Movie is not bad – on technical level.
       But compared to the book, it’s like watching a foreign movie that
       relies heavily on language and wordplay – without knowing the
       language it’s in, only reading the subtitles.
       All the subtext is missing.
       As for Rorschach…
       His death is supposed to show the ultimate impotence of his
       uncompromising attitude. And how silly he is in the grand scheme of
       things.
       Not a tragic dying hero – a fool. And a psycho. He’s even a literal
       bastard. Completely unloved by anyone.
       In the book his “friends” don’t even notice he’s gone – they are
       busy fucking.
       Cause that’s their reason for the whole superhero game.
       One has mommy and daddy issues, and implied that her parents were a
       sadist and a sadomasochist, so she goes for older men in tights
       like her mom did.
       While the other one can’t get it up unless he wears a funny suit.
       And then there’s the thing where the only guy who makes sense and
       who calls everyone on their bullshit – is a psycho bully sadist who
       guns down pregnant women bearing his own babies.
       He’s the guy whose words you should listen to and go “Well, he
       might be a babykilling psycho – but he makes sense.”
       Then comes THE villain as the “sensible” one – and the book makes
       you rationalize killing millions to save billions.
       And if you’re against that – then you’re a fool and we know what
       happens with fools.

       The Incredible Hulk was an OK film. I liked the acting, espescially
       from Edward Norton, the action was good, the best scene being the
       ending fight, and the effects were passable. But story wasn’t
       anything special, the villains were weak, and the writing was a
       little bland.

       In regards to the Suicide Squad reshoots,
       When the Bohemian Rhapsody trailer was released, I figured that SS
       must be a darkly humorous actioner. With the news that the reshoots
       are an attempt to inject some ‘fun’ into the film, I’m beginning to
       suspect that I was wrong and that the trailer’s music and editing
       mislead me.

       foot statue for his efforts.

       (who I don’t think is ever called by his comic book name) is

       knew the LAPD (and NYPD and any US PD) were racist and accused

       where it starts to get good, and feel more like the first one. Most
       of the actors did a fine job, especially Robert Downey Jr. and Don
       Chedle. Honestly, it’s the weakest film in the MCU so far.

       Iron Man has never been about villains, though. It’s more about the

       Alexander the Great babble… I never bought the killing millions to
       save billions, despite how reasonable this sounds.
       To me Rorschach’s death doesn’t symbolize his futility as a person,
       but rather his victory, cause he didnt flinch in the decisive
       moment. He’s the only moral guy in the story, Ozzymandias and
       Manhattan are just blind forces…utilitarians.

       I was wrong so wrong about BvS. I saw it again and liked it.
     * tOmy`
       I actually enjoyed Thor for some unspecific reason. I don’t even
       know why I watched it.
       I am trying to figure out when exactly I got on board with MCU and
       what was the first movie; sufficient to say that since I didn’t
       care at all, my expectations were dead low and I kinda enjoyed
       Thor. I think the comedy bits sorta worked for me.
     * tOmy`
       Possibly the weakest out of the 3. Yes, I do like my IM3.
     * Doctor Andre Son of Thomas.
       It could be worse its not like Australia just agreed to sell the

       But I suppose it takes a lot of energy to turn Moscow into molten
       glass that glows in the dark.
     * Doctor Andre Son of Thomas.
       yeah but your crazier than me.
     * tOmy`
       So anyway, since Palpy is catching up with MCU, allow me to
       backtrack as well:
       So I saw TFA again. This time sober, on a laptop screen. Well,
       “saw” might be a bit misleading because as I got to the
       “deactivation of the shield” part, I stopped the movie and didn’t
       finish it for two days. Anyways…
       I did forget some parts that are kinda cool, but boy oh boy, are
       there only few of those. I really expected that my level of alcohol
       during the midnight premier made me forget a lot of stuff,
       rendering the movie empty for me. I think I was wrong. During the
       whole runtime, I was like: “Oh, right, I remember that…” My
       persistent cringing and boredom was pretty much the same. However,
       I still dig the characters, Isaac is even better than I remember
       him, while the ever-so-brilliant Rey is kinda… too much of a
       brilliant genius.
       There are some godawful lines, the action fell flat for me yet
       again (except the thwords duels), the Han Solo smuggling subplot is
       fucking worthless and the biggest problem is still very palpable
       for me: I don’t care about any of this.

       My problem with the second Thor movie was it didn’t really feel
       like a Thor movie, it felt like a movie that Thor happened to be
       in. A lot of it seemed to be over his head until he had to start
       hitting things with his hammer.
       Loki was fun in it, but he’s always fun.
     * tOmy`
       Wellp, I will lover my expectations even more and maybe I will end
       up at least enjoying it. TFA didn’t totally ruin my Star Wars
       excitement, as 99% of what I liked was… well, Star Wars, so I am
       not exactly worried, just more cautions.
     * [829]Bagg of Stool
       I never got on board but I enjoyed Iron Man 3 and I think I liked
       the last part of IM2. Winter Soldier was a pretty good action flick
       that got really stupid near the end. Thor was just plain dull with
       Natalie Portman as the “believable love interest” once again… It
       was Episode II and III all over again… I think this made me never
       bother to watch Thor 2: Electric Boogaloo. Avengers was pretty fun,
       however.
     * tOmy`
       Yea, I think Thor was one of the first I saw, so I didn’t give a
       crap and thought: “Well, they are still making these movies and
       they are still bad. But at least it was fun.”
       I think IM and the rest pretty much made me care more and forget
       Thor (never seen Thor 2 either). IM3 was maybe the first time MCU
       got me actually interested.

       My idea (while watching it) was Rey being unable to pull off the
       flythrough, so to save them, she crashes through the side of the
       Stardestroyer, some piece of debris destroys the TIE and ends the
       pursuit.
       They crashland couple of miles away and upon trying to fix the
       ship, Rey accidentally enables some sort of a beacon that was
       disabled; that catches attention of Han and Chewie who are
       delivering the Cthullu monsters to Jakku.
       Han is pissed that she broke it, but since the smuggling
       organisations are on their tail, he agrees with her helping him to
       fix the ship; thus the bound is established – while she almost
       killed his favorite puppy, she also “repaid her debt” by helping
       him fix it, shows off her mechanical skills and so on.
       Ah, fuck it, I don’t know. It’s a minor issue, but the movie is

       So I heard the brand new album by One Direction’s Zyan Malik called
       Mind of Mine. Here is what I thought about this masterpiece:
       Let’s make sure that everyone understands it: This prog-pop album
       is a statement, it is a testament to all things sexual about Zyan’s
       empowered beautiful soul that has been held back by One Direction’s
       arguably great, yet reserved rock’n’roll. This is not what it
       seems. And Zyan let’s you know right off the bat with lyrics such
       as: “Be in the bed all day, bed all day, bed all day / Fucking in,
       fighting on / It’s our paradise and it’s our war zone“. It’s these
       little brilliant moments that expose the naked core of Zyan’s
       existence and his exploration of a 23 year old’s mindset,
       paralleled only to our generation’s greatest.
       During the 18 songs long album (which is hardly enough, folks),
       Zyan unshackles himself from the conventions of regular life,
       transcends to a higher ground of understanding and perspective, and
       like a majestic, unshaven eagle stalks his prey and with bullseye
       accuracy takes what is rightfully his: His existence, free from the
       slavery of average minds, that is as sexual as quite brilliant.
       Pop industry found its Dark Side of The Moon and Radiohead finally
       found their successor; but unlike Zyan, they need at least 5 people
       to keep up. 10/10

       So Thor came as a bit of a surprise for me. I didn’t think it was
       bad as people say it is. Well, for the most part anyway. Visually,
       the film looks great. Both Asgard and the Frost Giant world look
       amazing. I liked Chris Hemsworth as Thor, and Tom Hiddleston as
       Loki gave me a villain that I liked! The first and third acts are
       the best parts of the film. Sadly the second act is boring as shit
       and the characters Thor’s interacts with are dull, including
       Natalie Portman, whose character is as bland as Queen Armadilo.

       interest character is dull. B) Thor’s sudden “growth” happens over
       a weekend. C) The Destroyer is supposed to be this incredible
       weapon, and Thor takes care of it with a single swing from Mjolnir.

     * [853]instant relief
       I always kinda liked the first Cap movie for being kind of a
       throwback to Indiana Jones adventure romping. Hence, it’s better
       than Thor! 😉
     * Hank_Henshaw
       Those are less annoying than Natalie Portman.
     * Hank_Henshaw
       If the entire movie was like everything leading to Steve Rogers
       becoming Captain America (before he frees the soldiers), it’d be
       great. Sadly, the last third of the movie is complete nonsense.
       It’s basically a montage of nothingness happening.
     * [854]instant relief
       Yeah, it’s unironically good.

       I’m expecting the MCU to be just an OK series of films.
     * [855]instant relief
       True dat, I still ended up watching it 3 times, which I cannot say
       for Thor.
     * Hank_Henshaw
       I’m really hoping that the third Thor movie is a little of Planet
       Hulk, a little of Loki fucking up Asgard, a little of Thanos
       invading Asgard, and 0% Jane Foster and her wacky human pals.

     * The Elegant Flaw Filial
       I just watched Rich and Jack’s discussion about BvS. I thought it
       was a great discussion and raised a lot of good points that I’m too
       lazy to really suss out myself. I think they did a nice job
       refuting some of the commenters who were trying to defend the
       movie, as well.
       There were some points where I kind of disagree with them, even
       though I recognize that their opinions are totally valid.
       I agree with Rich that Batman’s decision to kill Superman would
       have been much more powerful if he were averse to murder in the
       first place, but I disagree with him when he says that it’s
       acceptable for Batman to kill criminals in this movie because
       Michael Keaton Batman also murdered people.
       I think that peoples’ conception of Batman was a little bit murkier
       around Keaton’s era. Like, the main image of Batman in the
       mainstream was Adam West’s Batman. So I think that it was
       acceptable for Tim Burton to shake things up by introducing a
       darker Batman who did darker things. Coming off the heals of the
       Christopher Nolan movies, though, a Batman who kills feels almost
       as out of place to me as “bat nipples” does. I can see how others
       would feel differently, but I was really put off by how casually
       and remorselessly Batman killed people in this movie. I really
       hated the movie’s insistence on “dragging down” the ideals of our
       heroes. They took Superman and made him Batman. They took Batman
       and made him The Punisher. Everything just felt SO WRONG.
       Plus, the Michael Keaton/Tim Burton version of Batman was “a” take
       on the character. And, even though there will never be a truly
       “definitive” take on Batman’s character, the fact that they’re
       making an extended universe makes it seem like they’re trying to
       create an “official” Batman. And I can’t really see an “official”
       Batman who has such a cavalier attitude toward lethal violence.
       I realize that this is pretty much me trying to impose my own take
       on the character on people who are trying to do something different
       with the character, but Batman’s actions in this movie just felt
       incredibly “off” to me.
       I think Batman, on some level, needs to believe that criminals can
       be rehabilitated, can be redeemed. And, in a movie where all this
       “Jesus” shit keeps getting shoved down our throats, redemption
       seems like an incredibly strange thing to leave out.
     * Mike Magnum
       I liked Thor 1 more than Thor 2. I really enjoyed the Loki/Thor
       relationship. And i liked the idea that under all that menacing
       exterior. Loki is just a little boy looking for his father’s
       approval. I wish that was explored more in Thor 2.
     * tOmy`
       I am still kinda sad they didn’t explore the WWII setting more. Two
       or three montages won’t cut it, folks. This could have been a
       totally different Avengers movie, as it is the only one not set in
       the “present”.

     * The Elegant Flaw Filial
       I also feel less positively toward this incarnation of Lex Luthor
       than they do.
       Yeah, “Mark Zuckerberg” is our conception of a billionaire these
       days, but I don’t think that Eisenberg was so grating just because
       he was given little material to work with– I honestly think that
       the performance, in and of itself, really sucked.
       Like, if you want to do the whole “sputtering millenial tech whiz”
       take on Lex Luthor then… it’s not my cup of tea, but they could
       have… maybe?… made it work?
       But Lex Luthor was like nails on a fucking chalk board to me. I
       don’t know of it was Eisenberg’s decision or Zak Snyder’s to give
       Luthor so many nervous ticks, but every time Luthor made that
       “MMMPH!” sound, I wanted to fucking throw something. I never
       sympathized with his character, I never found him menacing, I never
       thought he was funny. It was just a complete flat line for me.
       Like, he was given shitty material, but every time Jesse Eisenberg
       was on the screen, I wanted to get up and leave. I know that Lex
       Luthor is a mere mortal human being with a giant chip on his
       shoulder, but I think there should at least be SOMETHING about him
       that makes him a worthy adversary for Superman. I got nothing out
       of him in this movie. Both the character and the actor just sucked
       so bad.
       (Phew… thank God this comment wasn’t as long as the last one.
       Thanks to those who read these, by the way. Before I could move

       I’ve always hated that quote. Batman and Superman essentially have

       His “not flinching” leads to his demise.
       Cause he’s a right-wing fanatic and the one most clearly depicted
       as lunatic.
       Down to showing his psychiatric hospital files and his inner
       monologues about enjoyment he feels when he tortures and murders
       people.
       On top of that, while portraying him as this “unrelenting crusader
       for justice”, making the audience side with him – Moore doesn’t
       settle for showing him to be JUST a psycho with fascist tendencies.
       He fucks with the audience by further dressing down their “hero”
       and showing him as a bastard, whoreson, delusional, ugly, smelly
       homeless guy – AND a runt.
       He also hints that he’s a virgin who has trouble dealing with
       women.
       And then he unceremoniously kills him off.
       Not even his ideas and motivations are spared, robbing him of any
       chance for martyrdom, as it is revealed that he is a violent
       right-wing loon compared to whom Travis Bickle is a paragon of
       sanity.
       And Moore even makes him a BLIND fool, by making him a
       Hiroshima/Nagasaki apologist (in his schoolwork essay on his
       parents no less) and a Truman fan – cause killing all those people
       “saved millions” and “stopped war”.
       I.e. He actually agrees with Veidt’s methods. He just doesn’t
       realize it.
       And then Moore lets New Frontiersman editor “defend him” by NOT
       rejecting comparisons of “masked adventurers” to KKK – but by
       whitewashing KKK as people who simply had to do what had to be done
       to protect the safety of the community.
       Cause sometimes honor must go hooded.
       And that’s all just in-context.
       Ignoring for the moment the whole vigilantism aspect, he’s a guy
       who spends his nights violently hurting and murdering people.
       He’s a serial killer.
       Moore is all “Where’s your hero now? Nyaaah.” through the entire
       book, while fucking with the audience’s expectations and
       preconceptions.
       He literally throws “Do you also think that KKK were just people
       doing what had to be done to protect their loved ones when law
       failed to do so?” in the audiences face.
       But first he makes those characters SEEM sensible.
       Which are all things that Snyder missed.
       He just looked at pictures and copied what was there to the screen.
       Sometimes completely missing the point.
       Like when he takes Rorschach’s paranoid conflations of “Veidt’s
       decadence” and “possibly homosexual” remark – and makes Veidt
       rather effeminate (instead of more like a man who sells his own
       bodybuilding “method” through mail-order
       [892]https://juicedmuscle.com/jmblog/sites/default/files/images/ima
       ge15.jpg) while at the same time deliberately placing that “Boys”
       folder on his computer.
       Or when he makes “Mother forgive me” a repeated line for the
       Comedian, thus giving him mommy-issues – when that line is
       addressed to a statue of Virgin Mary Comedian sees in Moloch’s
       room, while having a drunken nervous breakdown.
       Or when he made his own kid play a son of a whore who rips other
       kids’ faces off and grows up to be a serial killer.
       Nah… all those connotations never phase him. He just thought it
       would be cool like that.

       It is possible he may have tried to give it a twist, especially the
       Mother forgive me thing. Just his personal touch, to “make you
       believe this movie is about something” as Susan said. I can’t talk
       about a lot of things since I just can’t remember them, it’s been a
       while.
       As far as Rorschach…he’s violent and crazy yes, but he’s not alone
       at murdering people. I think you are taking it too far, the fact
       that he’s unmasked, smelly etc only adds up to his character and
       make the reader sympathize more, downtrodden badass is always a
       win.
       The message I got (one of them) is that the only two righteous guys
       were totally crazy, each in his own way= there’s no hope in
       changing the world. Cause Ozzy’s plan will ultimately fail.
       I think Moore intentions are not that important, he had his own
       motivations for writing R and as he is, which you summarized pretty
       well.
       That doesn’t mean the reader has to agree or care, I’m not SP fan
       at all and this is probably the only “superhero” comic I’ve ever
       read in its entirety, which probably makes a difference? I throw
       this ad hominem at myself cause I think it’s important, Watchmen
       seems to have a lot of different lectures and meanings beyond “this
       character is the archetype for so and so…” , I’m sure it has its
       own exegesis made by fans and such.
       Now that I watched the movie, I’ll read it for the third time.

       I have this nagging feeling that other than a few this-or-that-punk
       and art deco enthusiasts and maybe George Lucas – no one actually
       gives a flying fuck about adventures in that time era.
       And just like with Pirates of the Caribbean – should action take
       place in the pre-ww2 past, it better involve magic and fantasy
       elements.
       Also, doing that shit right without it looking cheap and wrong is
       expensive – so you either cut corners OR you put your heroes in
       timeless locations.
       Which works great for a story about an archeologist who dives
       around ancient ruins that haven’t changed much in centuries.
       Which also allows you to make your hero more modern without him
       sticking out too much.
       And then there’s the whole bit where Harrison Ford is charismatic
       as all fuck – while Billy Campbell, Billy Zane and Alec Baldwin…
       well… are not.

       Do you like Phil Collins? I’ve been a big Genesis fan ever since
       the release of their 1980 album, Duke. Before that, I really didn’t
       understand any of their work. Too artsy, too intellectual. It was
       on Duke where Phil Collins’ presence became more apparent. I think
       Invisible Touch was the group’s undisputed masterpiece. It’s an
       epic meditation on intangibility. At the same time, it deepens and
       enriches the meaning of the preceding three albums. Christy, take
       off your robe. Listen to the brilliant ensemble playing of Banks,
       Collins and Rutherford. You can practically hear every nuance of
       every instrument. Sabrina, remove your dress. In terms of lyrical
       craftsmanship, the sheer songwriting, this album hits a new peak of
       professionalism. Sabrina, why don’t you, uh, dance a little. Take
       the lyrics to Land of Confusion. In this song, Phil Collins
       addresses the problems of abusive political authority. In Too Deep
       is the most moving pop song of the 1980s, about monogamy and
       commitment. The song is extremely uplifting. Their lyrics are as
       positive and affirmative as anything I’ve heard in rock. Christy,
       get down on your knees so Sabrina can see your asshole. Phil
       Collins’ solo career seems to be more commercial and therefore more
       satisfying, in a narrower way. Especially songs like In the Air
       Tonight and Against All Odds. Sabrina, don’t just stare at it, eat
       it. But I also think Phil Collins works best within the confines of
       the group, than as a solo artist, and I stress the word artist.
       This is Sussudio, a great, great song, a personal favorite.

       Well Captain America: The First Avenger was a pretty phun film. I

       lead, as were some of the other actors. The action was good, and I
       got an Indiana Jones vibe from the action, as well as the story.
       But story itself is a little cliche, and the villain wasn’t all

       So, that was The Avengers. Wow. I know I’m gonna sound like a
       complete Marvel shill when I say this, but I thought the film was
       pretty damn good. The writing was good, the story was nice, the
       acting was good, the action and effects were good, the characters
       all worked, and I finally got a villain that I thought worked! But
       of course there were things that annoyed me. The blue lasers firing
       up into the sky, the long action scenes, and the wanton 9/11 esque
       destruction. But still, it was a very good, enjoyable film.
       8.5/10.

       Avengers was the only Marvel movie I’ve seen in cinema. It was my
       ex’s date movie pick, I was kinda surprised. But I can speak for
       both of us and say we enjoyed it. As someone who has already seen
       couple of MCU movies, I had to explain to her couple of things
       further down the road but even despite that, she very much enjoyed
       it.
       Whole audience seemed to have good time. I think the movie worked
       exactly as it needed to.

       Good mindset but has he written good characters? Chronicle paints
       chracters in broad strokes allowing the actors to do the heavy
       lifting. In Me Him Her every character is just Max and American
       Ultra….uhm since you’re the only person on this webzone who seen it
       care to comment? Does Lex Luthor and Twilight girl carry the movie
       on their own shoulders?
     * tOmy`
       Nah, the characters are nothing to write home about, but you have
       the feeling they are pretty flashed out. (For example, the problem
       Mike and Jay had with the gay character is kinda bullshit. It made
       total sense in the movie and helped to characterize him even
       further.)
       Not saying he can write good characters, but he can write
       understandable characters.
       I just posted the quote because I feel like it explains a lot about
       his movies; the plot is either simple, simplistic or not so unique,

       but “being really small in a big environment” is kind of a subgenre

       It is true though, you can have films with no plot (Clerks, Dazed

       the characters actually have something to do other than wax
       philosophical about shit everyone has already pondered at some
       point in their lives.
     * Sully
       I actually enjoyed that one quite a bit more than I thought I
       would. It might help that I’m a big fan of Shane Black’s writing
       and Iron Man 3 is very much a Shane Black film (Christmas time,
       buddy-action, lots of shit talking, etc.).
     * tOmy`
       I very much enjoyed it till the final fight.
     * Sully
       Yeah…. yeah. But I have a feeling that was more Marvel’s notes, and
       less Black. That said, it does round off nicely after the finale
       with Stark’s end monologue. I preferred that ending to IM2.

       I could state zebra-batman’s powers, but it’s just a google search

       It might be pathetic to say this, but the only comic book I
       actually enjoyed was The Tripods. At least they didn’t use
       Deus-ex-machina constantly to write themselves out of dead ends in
       plots.
     * Palpatine

       When referring to comic books “deus ex machina” is referred to as

       hours, I’m going to lose my shit.
     * richardwicks
       Well lose your shit then.
       Comic books pissed me off because of their lazy writing. Always the
       writers wrote themselves into a dead end, and then, POW, GodMan
       solved the problem.
       It’s mastery to write a story you cannot predict whent if you were
       simply smarter and more creative you could predict it – I am always
       floored by that and I enjoy it. Memento is a favorite film of mine
       because of that.
       But – it’s absolute laziness to write a story that no intellect in
       the galaxy could predict, because it’s just pulling the solution
       out of your ass.
       It’s like reading a story written by Damon Lindelof. Fuck him.
       Fuck Damon Lindelof. Fuck him, let him die, fuck him. Fuck him,
       fuck him.
       I enjoy a masterful story, but don’t feed me bullshit and say that
       it’s a story. It’s just bullshit. Any asshole can make up complete
       bullshit.
     * Sully
       No shit, hence Batman v. Superman. I get why you used it, I’m just
       sick of seeing the term. I see it online about 40 times a day
       through various sites. It’s like watching the news and hearing the
       words “conversation” or “rhetoric.” Use a thesaurus, motherfuckers.
       There’s more than one way to make a point without sounding like a
       generic talking head.
     * richardwicks
       I don’t have favorite lazy writing moments, I just get pissed off
       when I see them.
       War of the Worlds could be interesting, if I didn’t think invading
       aliens weren’t totally stupid, but it’s typical of a comic book
       writer.
       I really REALLY enjoy being fooled by a film – given all the
       information to figure it out, and being unable to do it. This was
       the appeal of Sherlock Holmes stories, although they only gave you
       the IMPRESSION of being able to figure out the suspect. Usually it
       was impossible as well, but it gave you the impression it was
       possible at least. They were also lazy writing.
       Given the millions of dollars spent on films, you think they could
       get a genius writer is all I’m complaining about.
       Which brings me back to Memento. That was a masterful film. Perhaps
       some people could figure out the conclusion to that film, but I
       didn’t, and that was a joy to watch because of that. I should have
       been able to figure it out though, that’s the point. It wasn’t
       impossible, it was just very difficult. Heck, even Unbreakable is
       in that category, even though I figured it out partially before the
       end.
       When it’s absolutely impossible to figure it out, for anybody,
       that’s just a big lie, and I hate that. I think most people do.
       It’s crappy writing from writers that can create a mystery but not
       connect that to the solution.
       I truly don’t understand why people like comic books – it’s like
       they don’t care about progression in a storyline, they don’t mind
       it when they are lead into a dead end just to be whisked away into
       another storyline. There is no real continuity. I tried to read
       them, I tried to enjoy them, but I hate them, with a passion. The
       writers suck.
       It’s so annoying.
       In The Tripods, human civilization has been wiped out by an alien
       invasion force, and you can see humanity piece together from what
       the previously learned. It progressed, logically, and still
       unexpectedly. It was a great series for me as a kid. I couldn’t
       tell what would happen next, but what happened next was entirely
       logical. It was brilliant, and it was, as a side note, entirely
       educational. Very masterful comic.
     * Palpatine
       Iron Man 3 was so much better than the second one. The actors, once
       again, all did a fine job. The stuff with Tony is really well done.
       I really liked the whole plot of him of him dealing with PTSD and
       him having to start from sratch with the help of that kid, who
       surprisingly wasn’t all that annoying. Action and effects were once
       again pretty good. And yet, the villains sucked as usual. The whole
       Mandarian twist didn’t bother me too much, but I can understand why
       fans got upset over it. Dumbest moment by far is when Tony gives
       away his home adresses. What the hell man, are you that stupid?! Ah
       whatever, still a fine film otherwise.

       crap.

       Wait a fucking minute. So if Mike and Jay traveled back in time to
       the point where they didn’t go to a mountain top (because
       Plinkett’s house is still in the city), how come the new fuckface
       working for Lightning Fast got hired because of their homosexual
       mountain retreat?
       What the fuck? Is Martha behind this as well?
     * Sully
       I do like that Stark immediately regrets the decision in the film.
       “Pepper, keep away from the windows, I just threatened a terrorist
       on live tv.”
     * Sully
       The only hole in this plot belongs to Martha! HOLLA!!!
     * Sheriff Mitchell
       That exchange when Maya comes to the house is just great.
       It’s really the only Iron Man film I’ll ever need. They nailed it.
       It’s how Batman fans probably feel about B v S. They acknowledge
       that the film has its issues, but Batman was solid, so they can
       forgive its flaws.
       That’s how I feel about Iron Man 3. It has some issues, but the
       part I care the most about was the best part.

       Some of you may remember that couple of months ago, I was thinking
       about starting a Homing Pigeon service for sharing movies; much
       more effective, faster and fluffier version of torrents. And
       because today is as boring as these days can get, in two hours,
       Manhole will be streaming couple of homing pigeons documentaries.
       After that, the list returns back to its fluid form.
     * dollar store cashier wife
       homing pigeons documentaries? Is that code for F&F?
     * tOmy`
       No. I didn’t have time to cut F&F 4 to pieces and upload it to
       dayilmotion yet. But that day is approaching.
       Very fast. And furiously.
     * Palpatine
       I find pigeons to be very weird.
     * Sully
       Maybe it’s because I don’t get fooled by books or movies that I’ve
       learned to let a lot of shit slide. I remember people being blown
       away by Fracture, with Ryan Gosling and Anthony Hopkins. I’d
       already figured out that entire plot by the end of the first act.
       Unbreakable is another example. I’d already gathered that the film
       was going to be Shyamalan’s attempt at the superhero genre when
       first seeing the trailers, so by the time I watched the film I was
       already in that mindset. Seeing the birth of the baby in the
       beginning I knew it wasn’t going to be a traditional origin story,
       but instead a villain’s origin story; the how’s and why’s of a Lex
       Luthor-like character. It was still interesting to watch though and
       didn’t ruin the experience for me.
       Memento was the closet I’ve been to being wowed by a film’s ending,
       but it wasn’t so much a shock as an “Oh, okay.” Still a great film
       though.

       They did a poor job with the Extremis lava people. Their powers
       were inconsistent. Sometimes they could melt Iron Man’s armor,
       sometimes they couldn’t. Sometimes they could regrow limbs, other
       times they couldn’t. One of them vomits lava that one time, but
       they never do it again. The break-away armor joke was told way too
       many times. Why did they need to wait for the new armor to
       recharge… isn’t the arc reactor in Stark’s chest what powers the
       suit?All the other 40 suits had their own arc reactor. That was a
       waste of Rebecca Hall.
       Iron Man 3 was a movie I enjoyed while I was watching it, but as

       So Thor 2 was a little underwhelming to me. Not bad, just
       undwhelming. There were good things of course. Loki was eaisly the
       best thing about the movie, and his interactions with Thor worked
       really well. Chris Hemsworth as Thor was his usual badass self. I’m
       also glad a lot of time was spent on Asgard rather than Earth. Now
       the bad stuff. The villain was so boring, probably the weakest one
       in the MCU so far. All the Earth characters were boring as hell,
       and Kat Dennings was annoying as shit. I’m sorry, but this movie
       was right down there with Iron Man 2 as one of the weaker MCU
       films.
       6/10.

       Did you know most of the Loki stuff was reshoots? No kidding. Can’t
       imagine how dull the movie was before they added the Loki scenes.
       The Marvel people probably saw the movie and realized the
       Hemsworth/Portman chemistry was not salvageable. That’s why I hope
       the next one wont even try to have scenes taking place on Earth.

       Just got done watching Ant-Man. One of the best MCU movies. Just

       I think the reshoots, in addition to the negative reactions to BvS,
       are also because the second trailer presents Suicide Squad as a

       I thought it was about time to revisit The Dark Knight Rises, so
       I’m watching it on nettflix for the first time since seeing it in
       theatres. It’s shocking how much better a movie it is than Batman V
       Superman, There are obvious problems with it of course, the writing
       is weak in places, specifically the very ending and it’s contrived
       setup, Blakes flimsy explanation for figuring out Bruce Wayne is
       Batman, Thalia Al Ghuls completely pointless character who adds
       nothing to the movie and stops the film dead in every scene, taking
       away valuable Morgan Freeman time in the process and a few other
       smaller plot contrivances, like Blake just happening to find Gordon
       at the right sewer pipe for example. However there is a lot to
       like, the villain is compelling and his motivation makes sense.
       Blake is actually a pretty great character and I like this version
       of Catwoman a lot more than I did when I first watched the movie. I
       can’t remember why I had such a problem with her at the time, but I
       think it was partially Anne Hathaways over-exposure. In fact the
       performances all around are great. The concept of the Prison is
       great even if it is the most comic bookish element in the film and
       a little inconsistent with the realistic tone of the rest of the
       franchise. The one major problem I have with it is the pointless 8
       year gap, which I always retcon to 4 every time they say it.

     * [983]‘Undercover’ Nass
       The movie is masterfully setup and it has a drive and it has that
       drama and denseness in it that pushes the plot.
       Well, the prison was more a mythos of the mind that Bruce has and
       that’s why he is a weak Batman. It’s dumb in the realistic sense
       but still works as a character moment. It needed a counter weight
       or a setup and execution like in the first movies prison scene.
       It’s good storytelling not overtly relying on a loud score or cool
       visuals. I think it works well. I’ve gone from not liking it so
       much to loving it. It’s 1 Begins 2 Rises and 3 Dark Knight.
       They should have skipped the Thalya bit as you say.

       They took what was a one-dimensional character in the comics and

       Because why the hell not?
     * bleurgh
       I sort of almost came around on the Thalia character towards the
       end when I realised it was useful to have someone other than Bane
       be the trigger-person, but really it is just too much in an already
       very full movie and by the time we get around to her backstory
       being explained we don’t really care, because the movie is already
       mid-climax. That was valuable screen-time that could have been used
       to flesh out one of the many other characters in the film.
       I was also less bothered by the hokey ending with Alfred at the
       cafe this time as I convinced myself that it was actually Alfreds
       hallucination. Really though, Bruce should have just sent Alfred a
       letter, that would have both been more effective and they could
       have had him explain in a few lines why he chose to fake his death
       ‘I’m sorry Alfred, but now the Batman can be a symbol. An ideal to
       strive toward’ blah blah blah something like that, all this in
       voice-over on top of the image of the statue being unveiled.
       Perfect, no dumb contrived cafe scene, no pointless story by Alfred
       at the start of the movie.
     * WrongWithYourFace
       Batman v Superman really elevated my respect for the Nolan films.
       The way the story is constructed, scenes are shot, etc… Everything
       feels so much more solid and believable. Sure, the plot of TDKR is
       flawed at parts, but you can’t fault the film on the technical
       aspects. I think a standout comparison are the car chases between
       Nolanverse and Batman v Superman. The one in the latter was just a
       complete, incoherent mess, thanks to the horrible editing.

     * WrongWithYourFace
       I don’t remember much about the fights in Begins, but a lot of the
       hectic editing was purposeful to give you that feeling of a
       mysterious, unbeatable creature of the night: You don’t see what’s
       happening because the thugs have no idea what’s happening.
       TDK’s fights I always thought were horseshit. The messy editing
       felt more like a way to hide the bad choreography, than a stylistic
       choice. In TDKR they stepped up the quality a bit, and the majority
       of the fights are well shot, so you can clearly see what the
       characters are doing. There’s also acting incorporated into the
       fights; you can actually see what the characters are going through
       by the way they fight, whether they’re pissed off, getting tired
       and so on. Unlike in some other film…

       Bane wasn’t all that one-dimensional in the comics, though. He was
       a villain that could both physically hurt Batman, but also had the
       foresight and scheming ability to put Batman in a vulnerable
       position.
       He was far more cerebral than his depiction in “Batman & Robin”

       Guys, I really like how you review movies in general, but I have to
       say you reviewed this one really badly. I didn’t like this movie
       that much (7.5/10), but it’s like you decided to review this in
       Retard mode. It seems you don’t like Snider and want to trash
       everything he does without even trying to connect and/or
       remembering plot point that yes, WERE presented in the movie, but
       you conveniently opted for not talking about them. I think the
       biggest thing this movie got going for it is that it doesn’t spoon
       feeds the audience, it actually gives them things to think and talk
       about later. Even the people at Screen Junkies admitted they kind
       of enjoyed it. Get your heads out of your asses, watch it again and
       make a proper review of it, dummasses.
     * Sheriff Mitchell
       There is a difference between “asking the audience to do some of
       the heavy lifting” and “being f*cking lazy.”
       I’d say this film is firmly in the latter category, and Mike and
       Jay agree. You might not. But it doesn’t mean they reviewed the
       film in “Retard mode.”

       I heard Captain America: The Winter Solider was a good film, but I
       had no idea it would be that good. It was easily the best film in
       the MCU by far. In fact, I thought it was one the best comic book
       movies I’ve ever seen. The story, the characters, the writing, the
       twists and turns, the drama, all of them were very well done. The
       action was great and somewhat realistic, that scene in the elevator
       being the best example. Even the villain, who is just another guy
       in a suit, is actually pretty intimidating. My only complaint would
       be that the Winter Solider, (you know, the titular character),
       wasn’t in it as much as thought he’d be. But other than that, it
       was a really good movie.
       8.5/10.
     * Sheriff Mitchell

       Judge’s out on who’s lazy. I pointed out Screen Junkies just to
       show how actually lazy RLM actually were. It’s not about agreeing
       with me obviously, i respect a lot of friends who didn’t like the
       movie. But these guys didn’t even bother to analyze this movie
       thoroughly. Just the fact that they watched in terrible seats show
       how it affected their views on the fight scenes. Another indicator
       is the details they didn’t bother to pay attention to, actors
       reactions, plot point that, as i said, were in fact revealed. In
       the end they just wanted the movie they had in their heads, not
       what was presented. It is clear they dislike Snider and it shows.
       The movie is not perfect, but it’s far from being a mess, as Mike
       affirms. They dropped the ball on this one.
     * OMNI
       Like all reviewers their opinion is biased to a certain degree. I
       sometimes agree with “The Guys” sometimes I don’t. When I agree I
       smile, when I don’t I hurl pop-corn and swear words at my monitor.
       I also like that I’m a more knowledgeable movie nerd than these
       young RLM guys. I don’t think RLM knows the meaning of the words
       “Proper Review”, thank God.

       They didn’t analyze the movie thoroughly? The review proper was
       what, 35 minutes long? During which time they brought up editing
       mishaps, storytelling inconsistencies, wonky character motivations
       that are never explained, setups without payoffs, payoffs without
       setups, pointless scenes, etc.
       But I guess none of that counts?
       “It is clear they dislike Snyder.”
       They dislike Snyder’s fimmaking, sure. So what? Why is that held
       against them? He made the film, he’s subject to criticism.
       Using a positive Screen Junkies review to show “how lazy RLM
       actually were” is nonsensical. Their opinions are no more valid
       than anyone else’s. Instead of using someone else’s thoughts as
       evidence of the film’s brilliance, maybe write something to explain

       released so far including even all the Pre-Rec streams, but there’s
       just this minor thing that I’ve always noticed: I think reviewers
       overall could use a little less of the “contextualized” opinions.
       What I mean by this, is if I for example were to want to know
       someone’s opinion on Pirates of the Caribbean: On Stranger Tides I
       would rather want to know how the movie is like based on its own
       merits, rather than bringing the movie into context with what else
       has been released. Berating a movie because it’s doing something
       that’s been done before should not affect what the verdict should
       be of a movie, but rather a side-note. This might be a poor
       example, but what I’m trying to convey is that some people might
       not be “tired” of the Jack Sparrow character, or has never seen a
       Pirates of the Caribbean movie before. Thus, if the entire argument
       of why a movie is good or not hinges on an external factor the
       whole review becomes rather moot. If you go into the movie knowing
       you’re already tired of the character what’s the point in voicing
       your opinion about the movie? Do people not seek opinions about
       movies to know if they want to watch it or not, therefore probably
       factored in this matter? Can’t you decide such a factor beforehand,
       before even the movie has come out? Someone who is 30 now really
       won’t care if The Exorcist did something better so many years ago.
       Furthermore the whole statement of there’s already so much of this
       I find rather weird, not only are you never forced to watch a movie
       to begin with, there really aren’t that many movies coming out
       anyway. You can watch the entire MCU catalog in a brief weekend.
       It’s like stating you have too many parents (there’s only two…).

       Not necessarily.
       Even for your run of the mill plutonium you need nuclear reactors
       to synthesize it.
       Others are much more a bitch to synthesize (and keep for long
       enough to be recognized as elements). With stuff like cyclotrons
       and whatnot.

       Fun fact – when Fermi thought he had found plutonium, it was
       actually a mix of krypton and barium. True story.
       [999]https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hesperium
       As for kryptonite… it might be that it only crystallizes from who
       knows which elements under conditions of extremely high gravity.
       Or other special conditions, from heat to various other forms of
       electromagnetic radiation.
       Like conditions present at the time Krypton exploded… or at the
       epicenter of the explosion of the machine that was in the middle of
       the process of turning Earth into Krypton.

       I see what you’re saying, but… I don’t feel like Mike and Jay are

       They’ve said time and time again that they’re getting tired of
       comic book films, but they’ve been mostly positive towards them. I
       think in a recent episode Jay even said something like “Yes it’s
       tiresome, but you have to grade on a film-by-film basis, and a lot
       of these films are good.”

       If you hadn’t noticed Jack Sparrow is becoming more “normal” where
       as the other cast around him is becoming more “crazy”. The only
       arch for Jack Sparrow is to become more heroic and rational, until
       he has a moment where he “snaps” again and becomes totally
       unhinged.

       “Becoming more crazy” is basically the arch of the whole first

       Oh I’m not trying to say that Half in the Bag is especially guilty
       of this, not at all. It’s just that the times when I primarily
       disagree with the review the reason usually stems from too much
       negativity in relation to the context of films on the whole. I
       wouldn’t even know how to recommend to take a different approach
       either. Maybe something like in the beginning of the review along
       the lines of (using your example): “I just want to say beforehand
       I’m getting tired of these comic movies, hence my opinion might be
       slightly more biased towards negativity than it probably deserves.”
       But that would be rather… I don’t know.

       Jesus-Superman won’t resurrect on the 3rd day, but he will in the

       millions of ants to eat people alive and Ant-man would shrink,
       enter someone’s digestive system and then grow in size to explode
       them from inside. I mean, why not? That’s how he would treat the

       You’re not paying attention to what i said, just like they didn’t
       pay attention to the movie they reviewed, so you’re just
       co-relating the amount of time spent analyzing everything
       “half-assedly” as it being good, which is not. I mentioned Screen
       Junkies because even them, huge Marvel fans, were obliged to admit,
       by fans and logical explanations from guests (watch this week’s
       movie fights, it was actually good) that the movie was not all bad
       as they had made it out to be.
       I will repeat again, because you didn’t read before or chose to
       ignore, so here it goes: I didn’t find the movie perfect (7.5/10),
       but it was way better than this guys are making it out to be. I’ll
       stop wasting my time here now, so take care!

       It’s possible to both 1) Understand what you’re saying and then 2)
       Disagree with what you’re saying. And I’m asking you to explain to
       me why you thought the film was so good, instead of using Screen
       Junkies as evidence. Because I don’t think Screen Junkies is
       reputable. And it says nothing about what YOU think of the film.

       Probably. I think of these films as a fun supplement to the comics

       victim.

       I am actually scared of Infinity War , even in the comics it is so
       bloated with characters it was very trying to keep my head in the
       game.
       Civil War can be scaled down, I think it will work as first
       Avengers movie worked. Follow only core characters (Spiderman is
       thankfully known property, I just don’t know how they will explain
       his relationship with Stark). The only character they really need
       to introduce is Black Panther.
       I think Wheadon wanted to do too much, and when he was cutting
       down, studios made him leave the things that bloated the movie.

       talk abbot Bioshock: Infinite which I have been struggling to

       really capture that lightning in a bottle everyone loves.
       I just got the Burial at sea DLC and I’m really impressed, so why
       didn’t Irrational base the Infinite game in rapture before it was

       So basically what you’re saying is that you feel the same way about
       Pirates as you feel about The Fast and The Furious?
       But yeah, what I’m saying is, I haven’t seen a single Jack Sparrow
       meme in ages. Pirates of the Caribbean used to be a pretty big
       thing for me too. I even got the first three on DVD as soon as they
       came out. The fourth one I did go see out of an obligation of sorts
       (yes, Pirates was that big for me) but I really don’t remember
       anything at all about it. It’s been so long by now that I really
       could care less about the series anymore.

       That movie just occupies space. It just exists. It’s kinda
       forgettable, full of massive plot holes and pretty boring.
       Even the third one, despite being more convoluted than MCU, was at
       least fun. And it had couple of those “fuck yea!” moments.

       I do remember thinking it was massively overrated.
       Also, this has nothing to do with the film itself, but as I was
       sitting in the theater during the post-credit scene, a guy in front
       of me was all pissy that they did the Howard the Duck thing and
       didn’t set up the next film.
       Like, he couldn’t enjoy the film he just watched for all of five
       minutes before he’d moved onto the next thing.
       Left a bitter, kale-like taste in my mouth. And it hasn’t totally
       left.
     * WrongWithYourFace
       Oh, god! Now I remember: The fourth one had that giant gypsy woman,
       didn’t it? Jeebus…
       In the third one what stuck with me the most was the stone crab
       scene. It was just refreshingly imaginative in a big budget movie
       like this.

       Thanks to Asian pirates (Kōngqì dàn guāng do, fǎngfú tiānkōng zài
       ránshāo…) I finally saw Hail Caesar!
       Calling this movie underrated would be a fucking underrated
       understatement of the term underrated.
       First of all… Everyone is fucking perfect in it. Perfect in their
       movie roles AND a perfect stereotype.
       Which is probably where lies the main problem this movie had with
       the audiences.
       No… Not the problem the audience had with the movie. Movie had a
       problem with the audience.
       This was the case of a Coen Bros audience expecting a Seth
       MacFarlane movie DESIGNED FOR the Coen Bros audience.
       I.e. References instead of jokes – but obscure historical
       references.
       Stuff only “smart people” know and understand.
       Not stuff that just any pop culture peasant would know.
       No, no, no… pop culture references for connoisseurs.
       Artisan pop culture references. Pop culture references with a
       pedigree.
       Dig back a few months and everyone is patting themselves on the
       back by guessing (correctly they assume) who everyone is. That’s
       Esther Williams, that’s Fred Astair, that’s Richard Burton, that’s…
       Then it turns out – they were completely wrong! Oh noes!
       “You mean I reread all those imdb biographies of dead stars for
       nothing? But, but, but… I’m smart and educated! I watch movies with
       subtitles!”
       Then on top of that “insult” to the overinflated sense of
       self-worth and intelligence of their intended audience – Coen Bros
       had the balls to have the movie NOT be about the biggest star in
       it.
       Or ANY star in it.
       Instead, all the star parts are mere bit parts.
       As if they are just cogs in the picture industry, whose lives only
       have worth as far as that they ARE cogs in the picture industry and
       whose individualism can be dictated by the industry.
       Industry which treats Jesus as an extra.
       THEN… movie has communists who are in it (as in – in the whole
       communism thing) only for the money and capitalists who don’t care
       about the money and who are in it for the ideals and for something
       greater than themselves.
       There goes THAT expectation, out the window and straight on its
       head.
       Even the main character, the wheeler-dealer, the fixer, agonizes
       about not being truthful to his wife about sneaking in a cigarette
       or two.
       While the dumb cowboy is actually a charming kindhearted and
       multi-talented guy.
       Just as the prima donna actually falls for a “good, reliable man”
       who’s “bonded, miss”.
       And the gayish male dancer singing about going off to sea with a
       bunch of sailors turns out to be… a gay communist escaping to
       Russia on a submarine full of sailors… while secretly also being in
       it for the money.
       While the communist-convert movie star ends up acting praises to
       the Son of God – and the common man, “the little guy”.
       AND IT IS FUCKING HILARIOUS!
       Every joke is partly about depicting a stereotype to the point of
       satirizing it – then reversing the expectations about the
       stereotype.
       That is, unless it is simply about satirizing a stereotype.
       From stereotypical priests detached from god, through communists
       who are all about empty rhetoric while actually only after the
       money, a blond Jesus who is an extra whose face is never shown so
       as not to offend, a gay dancer petting a tiny dog (named after
       Friedrich Engels)… to the “This motion picture contains no visual
       depiction of the godhead.” in the credits and how EVERY problem
       gets solved by the time Hollywood happy ending arrives.
       It’s not a movie too smart for the audience.
       It’s a movie whose intended audience was expecting it to be a
       different kind of smart – factual and clever instead of intelligent
       and silly.

       Watched Born on the Fourth of July for the first time in decades
       last night. That movie came out in 1989! I didn’t know it was an
       80’s movie. Anyway maybe it was because I remembered most of the
       story but it wasn’t as emotionally devastating as it should have
       been. Stone hadn’t moved on to his signature visual and editing
       style he started developing with JFK and which came to full
       fruition with Natural Born Killers (and now he seems to have mostly
       abandoned, which is almost criminal in my mind, this style and
       approach to film being the biggest contribution has has made to
       world of film-making to my mind). It’s a pretty straight movie. The
       only thing that surprised me was how much I kept thinking Tom
       Cruise is underrated as an actor. I know, I know. There’s a lot to
       hate about the guy and he has a very punchable face. Most of what
       we hate about him though comes from his personal life. If you look
       at just the acting, it’s far from horrible. Oliver Stone and
       Stanley Kubrick had enough faith in the guy to make him their lead,
       so there’s that. You can make the argument that “he always looks
       like Tom Cruise,” but honestly there are dozen of other actors you
       could say the same thing about (and how come nobody ever says it
       about Denzel Washington? He always plays himself and doesn’t have
       as much range as Cruise does, but Denzel wins oscars and is
       considered a “good” actor.) Overall a decent movie that tells the
       true life story of a well known war activist and the massive
       problems that come along with war that nobody wants to talk about
       until the war is over, if ever.

       Blade Runner is frowned upon, even today, by the current masters of

       The visual style in NBK was a mash up of other styles, almost the
       approach of a hip hop producer, “sampling” things. Things like
       putting a laugh track and giving a sticom feel to the scene when
       Mallory was about to raped by here father… The editing between
       black and white and color, from “cinema quality” 35mm to gritty
       16mm, and I think even some video was used… It feels like it takes
       a lot of cues from music videos (remember when MTV played those?).
       Everything was very over the top, but in a good way because it gave
       everything so much more impact. I’m sure some people thought it was
       distracting, or maybe even gimicky, but to me it was brilliant. He
       can do a more subtle version of it though, you can see bits and
       pieces of it in Nixon. To me this style is the most original thing
       he has done, and seems like his own voice. For him to go back to
       more traditional shooting and editing feels like Monet deciding to
       give up impressionism and start painting like Rembrandt.

       I heard his “review”. It was depressing. He goes point by point,
       explaining nothing in the movie really works (motivations, tone,
       acting, pacing, plot holes, etc.), only to say he had to like it
       because Parademons, and his buddy was in the movie.

       He also liked Revenge of the Sith because it had lava in it.
       If BvS concluded with 45 minutes of Superman on the toilet with
       explosive diarrhea, Keven Smith would’ve given it 5/5. Not because
       he’s an explosive diarrhea fan, but because he is the literal
       definition of a comic book fanboy. And he’s Ben Affleck’s friend.
       The only person more biased is probably Zack Snyder. So I’m not
       sure Smith is the best guy to ask.

       I’ve heard (on comment boards, so whatever) that Hollywood’s
       pandering/tailoring for the international, i.e. Chinese market is
       making these huge films not just more bland, but less diverse, i.e.
       whiter. The theory goes that Chinese (or a great number of them)
       are turned off by black and brown heroes.
       I think any attempt at attracting a world-sized market will result
       in a blander product – I hesitate to blame Chinese tastes.
       Who knows? Interesting times!

       Not really. Species is not being played – individuals are.
       Species doesn’t even know there is such a thing as a movie studio.
       Species doesn’t have a brain to think with nor senses to grasp
       with.
       Species and societies on the other hand rely on individuals to
       flock to the groups and to value acceptance over their own
       individuality.
       Hell… all our virtues revolve around self-sacrifice for the good of
       others, while all our failings are individualistic.
       So it is perfectly logical that humans will seek themselves a
       “tribe” which supports the choices they’ve already made – or that
       they will bandwagon with popular opinion.
       And once there, in the tribe, of the tribe – various other biases
       kick in.
       From those that support and protect the tribe from the outside
       attacks to those relating to the sunk cost of investing in joining
       a tribe in the first place.
       Species and societies love conformism and status quo as they make
       for stable societies – and abhor individualism and change.
       Cause a society A that changes into a different society (B) must
       die in order to change. Change kills societies.
       E.g. Society that keeps slaves must first give up slavery in order
       to be a society which is against slavery. So, slaver society must
       die.
       It’s the world that favors change (cause there’s no such thing as
       stopping or turning back time), and which forces species and
       societies to adapt to them – the very existence of societies being
       one of the bigger favorable changes.

       Trump in Wisconsin, Gives Advice on Success
       “When I saw all this youth, this great-looking, young people, I
       said I’m going to talk for a few minutes about success. Should I do
       that?” Trump asked the crowd gathered at St. Norbert College in De
       Pere, Wisconsin
       “And you’ll find that when you become very successful, the people
       that you will like best are the people that are less successful
       than you, because when you go to a table you can tell them all of
       these wonderful stories, and they’ll sit back and listen,” he said.
       “Does that make sense to you? OK? Always be around unsuccessful
       people because everybody will respect you. Do you understand that?”

       where the characters are stronger than the story.

       The movie did a really good job of introducing us to the characters
       and the different segment of the Marvel universe that it took place
       in. That really all it had to accomplish and it did it masterfully.
       The story is kinda “meh” but it served it’s purpose. It brought the
       characters together and helped set up a larger story in the future.
       There are a number of moments where it asks you to forgive certain
       inconsistencies and plot holes, which you do gleefully because you
       want to see these characters succeed. It’s not a perfect movie but
       it’s a fun movie, which is what movies are supposed to be.

       Yea, they are definitely effects used on the vocals, but you can
       hear the actual voice coming through; she has a lot of moments
       superficially designed to showcase her range. But I feel you.
       The shitty thing is that even really good singers fuck around with
       auto-tune. When you hear tracks by Panic! At The Disco and realize
       that the guy can pretty much pull off Sinatra, then one has to
       wonder why is he using auto-tune “as an effect” on other songs.
       It’s just worthless.

       Well, what I meant is that all the digital trickery and

       this year, I don’t remember a single rock outfit that wouldn’t rely
       heavily on all these elements; including Bowie.
       Okay, Iggy Pop was an exception.
       I mean, it’s nothing new, but the lines blur more and more. Don’t
       get me wrong, I don’t have a problem with that, or not a big one at
       least, but the digital trickery sank its teeth deep into the
       musical consensus. It’s only logical, but it can be derogatory.

       Digital changed everything. Yes, that’s what is left, mixing

       (apparently). Now is all about the texture.

       “According to Jeff Goldstein, Warner Bros.’ executive vice
       president of distribution, however, the decline in ticket sales was
       a part of the studio’s distribution plan.
       In addition to the film being released on Easter weekend, it opened
       Thursday at 6 p.m., as opposed to the typical Thursday show time of
       9 p.m. This allowed for two showings of “Batman v Superman,” as
       opposed to just one, which alone brought in $27.7 million. Such
       numbers helped the film set its record-breaking $166-million
       debut.”

       in Killing Joke is basically tailor made for Mark’s take on the
       character. Or rather, Mark’s take is tailor made for that version
       of The Joker. As a fan of voice acting, I’m excited even to just

       I asked a stupid fangirl yesterday why does she write fan fiction?
       She told me it’s because the guys in movies/shows are hot. So the
       main reason creepy Reylo shippers exists is because people want to
       fuck Adam Driver.
     * junkevil
       Before that movie came out, I was convinced it would be the biggest
       flop of the MCU. I was aware of the comic and didn’t think they
       could make a team led by a talking raccoon and his tree friend
       work. I was happy to be proven wrong when the movie was great. Not
       without it’s flaws, but great nonetheless.

       Part of a conversation I had this morning:
       “It’s not that the movie is bad, it’s that YOU don’t like it.”
       Yes. I don’t like it because it’s bad. Is this what conversation in
       2016 is like now? I can’t just say something sucks donkey balls
       anymore? I have to specify that “While some might like it, I did
       not?”
       Ah, no. I don’t like it. Because it sucked.
       It’s rainy this morning and I ain’t takin’ no shit, fellas.

       Almost every conversation I have these days involves a 30 second

       said. I’ve pretty much just stopped talking to people.
     * WrongWithYourFace
       Teachers used to say the same thing on first grade, only about
       food. I guess that had some truth, though, as you can’t objectively
       judge whether food is good or not (unless you compare two versions
       of the same course).
       But really, it’s kind of like when people [on the internet] say:
       “But that’s just your opinion.”Of course it’s my fucking opinion,
       that’s why I’m saying it! If it weren’t, I would clearly state
       whose it is. It’s like I need to start every sentence with “in my
       opinion” these days (or IMHO, as the kids say, which is probably
       the most useless abbreviation, for aforementioned reason).
     * Tapeworm
       At that point in a conversation you know it’s not worth trying
       anymore. “Yeah, YOU think that” is just ad hominem light. Unless
       we’re talking evidence based areas, it’s subjective. The point is
       to have reasons backing up your opinions and provide those.

       Now I am kinda scared to ask. As in: Black Parade album will always
       be one of the strongest “bad mood” albums, because it both speaks
       to you and at the same time mocks you for even feeling bad. It has
       this… collective middle finger about itself. It has that “we feel
       you, brah” and at the same time it has the “the fuck is wrong with
       you, this is a joke” vibe to it.
       Back to F&F!
     * Sheriff Mitchell
       I can assure you that – from the earliest days – they have always

       It is pretty great to have it reaffirmed.
     * Sheriff Mitchell
       And!
       I always found the MCR backlash to be weird, though I do have an
       insider perspective.
       I was right in the thick of it when they blew up and got that deal
       with Reprise. The same people that were shitting on them when “The
       Black Parade” came out were the same people that – just a few years
       earlier – were singing “All we are is bullets, I mean this” at the
       top of their lungs at all their sold-out gigs.
     * tOmy`
       My personal problem (far from the insider view) was that people
       labeled them as that “one band that people hang themselves to”,
       like some kind of a super-depressive shit.
       While Black Parade is full of fun, jokes and smiling… sure, in the
       face of bad shit happening to you… but still:
       When I wanna feel down, dirty and all sorts of glamorously fucked
       up? I turn on Placebo. When I feel like I wanna get introspective,
       I turn on Radiohead.
       But when I wanna have that bittersweet energy, down a couple of
       beers and no matter how bad I feel, come out with a grin on my
       face, My Chemical Romance was always there and even in 25+ years, I
       still jam to their songs. There is something to their vibe I
       wouldn’t trade.
     * Sheriff Mitchell
       Because they were unique, a little cheesy, didn’t take themselves
       too seriously, but had fun riffs, memorable hooks and a thumping
       punky drummer.
       It’s funny. Years after all my friends started shitting on them,
       the only song any of them would admit to still liking was
       “Cubicles.”
       Which is a great song, of course. But I’d bet my life on them
       listening to Bullets in its entirety on a private Spotify session
       every now and then.

     * tOmy`
       The only moment I sorta grew up out of them was Danger Days album.
       I very much enjoyed it at first, the concept still holds, it is a
       fun album…
       But it feels like there is too much of a “safe” music. By now, the
       only songs I do like from that album are the obnoxiously loud /
       fast / in your face tracks, but a lot of it sounds kinda… juvenile.
       At that very point of “history”, I think Billy Talent handled
       themselves much better and swapped that theatrical-poet-romance for
       the uproar about “establishment”, and while it does sound cheesy, I
       still feel like they came in swinging and doors-kicking.
     * Mitchell Taco Nash
       I posted somewhere on here that it would drop 70% this weekend and
       only gross $50M. It dropped 69.1% and grossed $51.3M. Seems I was
       very close. 😉 It dropped this steep without any competition at all,
       which is awesome.
       Basically, it’s one of the fastest dropping superhero films of all
       time. I’ve been tracking it and I don’t think it will reach $1B
       because of how poorly not only critics are receiving it, but
       general audiences. Marketing got it to a $166.0M opening weekend.
       Word of mouth is having it drop off a fucking cliff, thank god.
       So, cynicism aside that audiences are dumb and go to these things
       with their brains turned off (Star Wars and Jurassic World come to
       mind, although those are lightyears ahead of this in terms of
       cohesive narratives and overall quality), it seems BvS is too bad
       to keep chugging along and is falling like the shitshow it is. 🙂

     * Like Icare
       It’s been like that for quite some decades.
       Basically… it’s postmodernist bullshit, advocating the idea that
       truth is a social construct, leeching into “common sense”.
       I.e. There is no such thing as objective truth, everything is just
       subjective opinion – ergo my subjective opinion has the same value
       as yours.
       Naturally, that’s bullshit as it ignores both the quantity of
       information and quality of it, as determined by what is essentially
       math (i.e. logic) and basic laws of the universe.
       In a perfect world, issue would solved by the “Hard Truths”.
       I.e. Solid objects you would throw at people’s head until they
       concede that you really ARE objectively hitting them.
       Sadly, most people fail to learn the actual lesson there and might
       even attempt to sue you, which is ironic as the whole thing started
       over their disbelief in objective truths which are a necessary
       prerequisite for proving anything.

       KEENE — A Troy woman was arrested Thursday for selling “Donald
       Trump” branded heroin. The heroin was packaged in dosage-sized bags
       stamped with the words “Donald Trump,” police said.
       When the buyer brought this second bundle to the detective, he
       wrote in the arrest affidavit, “I also observed that each wax bag
       was stamped with a ‘Donald Trump’ logo.”
       Trump heroin is the world’s finest heroin, now available

       End the saga as an “homage” to Alice Sheldon AKA James Tiptree, Jr.
       by making the final story a retelling of her “The Earth Doth Like a
       Snake Renew”.
       “The Earth Doth Like a Snake Renew,” is a reversal of the earlier
       Tiptree story, “The Last Flight of Doctor Ain,” her first
       widely-acclaimed piece.[5]
       In this story, the Earth is male and the main character is a young
       woman named “P.” P is in love with the Earth and obsessively
       desires to find a way to physically consummate that love. She is
       also a submissive masochist.
       The relationship between the two is portrayed as abusive,with the
       Earth harming and manipulating the protagonist, while
       simultaneously providing for her. Ultimately, the Earth is shown to
       not truly love her, but, rather, to love another planetoid.
       This planetoid crashes into the Earth, knocking it off its orbit
       and killing all life, including P. Just as the love was one
       directional, so was the power.
       Then you can move on onto planet-sex fiction. You can call the
       series “Heavenly Bodies”.

       time runs out.
       And it still has 4.5 months to get there.
       As for the drops… it’s a faulty measuring tool for accounting will
       the movie or won’t it make $1B.
       Drop is an index value – i.e. it’s a percentage drop compared to
       the previous week’s results.
       All it accounts for is how the movie is doing CURRENTLY compared to
       the last measurement made.
       It does not deal in absolute values, accounting for some whole
       number of possible tickets sold or money made.
       Thus, its actual absolute value in money (that they fail to make
       according to magical prognosis and wishful thinking) gets smaller
       as they make less.
       The less it makes – the less it is losing with each drop.
       Similarly if the drop turned into a gain next weekend, and the
       movie made 105% of what it made this weekend – that only means $2.5
       mil more.
       Meanwhile, the daily/weekly average cut they need to make is
       accounted in real money, not percentages, and it is getting smaller
       with each dollar they make.Just like the “finish line” of $1B is
       accounted in real money – not percentages.
       I.e. Drop is measuring the length of a step compared to the last
       step made – not how much of the road is already covered and how
       many more steps are needed.

       I was kinda scared after 4th episode as well. But I absolutely love
       the continuation of his storyline throughout the season. They gave
       him dimensions, used him for the legal, detective and news angle of
       the show and pairing him up with Karen was great.
       Elektra was kinda…yea. That whole romantic subplot wasn’t exactly
       needed and it seemed kinda uneven. They should have centered it all
       around Punisher.

       Ladies and gentlemen, let us toast to the death of EDM:
       “Vegas turns up nose at superstar DJs,” Page Six reported in late
       March. A week before that, the Miami Herald noted, “On eve of Ultra
       Music Festival, the dance-music craze is slowing down.” And after
       Miami Music Week, the unofficial party crawl accompanying Ultra,
       two Beatport editors noted, “Half-empty pool parties, quiet streets
       in Miami Beach, short lines, and a relative availability of cabs
       and car services all told the same tale”: “MMW was dead.”

       Frankly, the overabundance of characters is second on my list of
       things I deeply dislike about superhero comics.
       The first is the need to jump across various issues with other
       characters just to tell a simple story.
       For that one I get the urge to burn someone and their children and
       pets.
       But the overabundance of characters is a really close second.
       Cause it ruins the story. Or the characters.
       Cause now everyone needs something to say and do – or they are only
       there in order to die and thus get the real heroes motivated to
       blah-blah…

       EDM is / was however fucking despicable, because it drove actually
       good DJs ghostwriting for these “stars” who then took the credit.

       kinda find them the same. They put on a gimmicky one note character
       for comedy effect and do coverage of shitty,old and often obscure
       games. I don’t know why you hate one and like the other but

       killing (or fucking… whatever) him just cause her character had an
       epiphany later on the toilet?

       Now the car had in the front, a bottle of coke, a bottle of water,
       a fire extinguisher and in the back seat was 4lt of engine
       coolant….
       He passed me the bong… with half a cup of dirty water in it…. I put

       It’s weird, when I google it I find a bunch of sites owned by
       Gawker going on about how there is this harrasment campaign on the

       can see are people upset that the game doesn’t work due to all the

       The man who came up with a baboon riding a tank was Lana Turner’s

       written by Hughes himself.
       To quote the article: “Almost anyone who could prove otherwise is
       now dead.”
       Also, he’s planing a comeback movie in which he will be played by

       There are also some other issues (mostly technical) with the game
       but the press decided to highlight the controversy. I don’t mind a
       trans character in BG unless it’s written well. This one, clearly
       is not.

       From that screenshot it looks like the game is making fun of the

       who create their identities by assembling them from “syllables from
       different languages”.
     * [1367]Cap’ ‘Murica V Iron-Magg
       You know, Baldur’s Gate 2 actually had a quest in which a character
       undergoes a magically induced sex change… as a hubris for it’s
       quest for power. He was a misogynist too, so that taught him a bit
       what it feels when people treat you differently. Most of the quest
       was played out with humour but if you didn’t change his sex back to
       the original, he ended up as a wench in a tavern. He used to be a
       pretty powerful mage before, though. I wonder whether the ending
       highlighted the glass ceiling or how one’s unhappiness with their
       body may affect their life.

       Im going to take it nobody here saw the remake of Point Break. Well
       I watched today and it was pretty bad. Instead of Robbing Banks for
       you know, Money. They do other illegal things for “spiritual
       reasons”. They do rob one bank. But no Presidents mask. I pretty
       disappointed that i didn’t see Obama, Bush and Clinton rob a bank.
       The Guy who plays Johnny Utah makes Keanu Reeves look like a
       Shakespearean Actor and the Guy who played Bodhi didn’t have any of
       the charisma that the Late Patrick Swayze had. I mean the original

       updating the presidents though.

       I’ve been keeping track of the box office for almost a decade now
       as a hobby. The percentage drops between weekends and weeks is
       probably the best indicator as to how the film will perform.
       In its first week (plus a few extra days overseas) it grossed
       $553M. To reach $1B, it needs to have weekly drops better than
       58.8%. Its first week so far will drop 69-70%. If it drops 50% from
       here on out, it will gross ~$340M. With a domestic/overseas split
       of 38/62, that’s an overseas gross of ~$550M for a worldwide total
       of ~$880M.
       It would need to have weekly drops of 36% from here on out to gross
       $1B. If a film like BvS drops 69-70% between its first and second
       week, you can bet it won’t average 36% drops. It’s not going to
       reach $1B. Personally, I’m thinking $350-$360M domestic and $600M
       overseas for a $950-$960M total, but not $1B.

       You know i could totally see McConaughey as Bodhi. I dont know
       about Gosling. I say one good thing about the new movie. The stunts
       are pretty well done and the scenery is great (lot of stuff in the
       mountains). Just to bad it wasn’t in a better movie. I think they
       should use the footage for a 3D documentary instead.

       Don’t forget guys, 10 hours from now (cca), TheManhole will be
       streaming Fast & Furious (not to be confused with The Fast and the
       Furious), the 4th installment in F&FCU, that is technically a soft
       reboot, but actually half-sequel to The Fast and the Furious,
       half-sequel to 2 Fast 2 Furious and a prequel to The Fast and The
       Furious: Tokyo Drift. Or something like that.
       Anyway, strap in for one last ride with the movie that is labeled
       dull, because it somehow makes sense and it is kinda competent, and
       help us answer the following questions:
       1) How is Brian still working for FBI?
       2) How long into the movie till somebody says “Ride or die”?
       3) Why is the GPS featuring PC game graphics and sexualized women?
       4) What exactly Vin Diesel says at any given time, except the word
       “familia”?
       5) And more importantly: What?
       So shift your gear to bad acting and simple plot made convoluted
       due to the timeline of the series, because cars! But who cares? You
       fill your face with popcorn, you dumb fat cows! Eat the slob before
       the slaughter, you fucking pigs!
       Only at TheManhole.

       Storming the beach at Mos Normandy was pretty cool with those

       WAR?!”
       I’m hoping they won’t do a whole shitzillion character cameos who –
       surprise – show up in the main series later on. “Imagine meeting
       you here, Boba Fett. What a small fucking galaxy.”

       This looks… interesting. So get ready for disappointment.
       Digging the theme, tho.
     * Sully
       So far they’ve promised this film will be “light on the force” so
       that should put the schlock to a minimum from the get go. The only
       Jedi/Sith in the film is supposed to be the classic Vader.
       I hate that small universe shit. What’s the point of making a
       galactic war film if it only revolves around one dysfunctional
       family?
     * tOmy`
       Is it the time to start masturbating over my far-fetched theories
       that the chick is definitely Mara Jade, get fucked, I know it is

       I thought that too.
       “What will you become…” *cut to: EMPEROR’S HAND!
     * Sully
       I hope not. I like Mara Jade, too, but I get the feeling most of
       these characters are going to bite the dust in this film, or be
       assimilated into the Empire. I got that vibe from this trailer as
       well.
       [Edit: I don’t see how they’d be able to fit the Jade storyline
       into the fixed film universe]
     * tOmy`
       I was mostly joking. I know they won’t make Mara Jade because that
       would result in an interesting movie. Plus she is a ginger.
       Plus she was on the Empire side since the early age, nope?
       I think the “assimilation” is just undercover shit to get them
       plans.
     * Doctor Andre Son of Thomas.
       Thats the point. this is a MJ origin story.

     * Sully
       It would be an interesting twist though.
     * [1478]‘Undercover’ Nass
       Yeah, it could work. I’ll redact previous comments about SW not
       functioning without the Skywalker drama. It must have been the Sith
       sh*t bogging it down. Pity it’s still the Star Wars Universe. I’d
       love a big blockbuster space war movie but not in this universe.
       I’ll hate hearing the cheering and clapping at the cinema when
       “Star Wars things happen”. NO FUN ALLOWED!
     * Sully
       “No fun allowed!”
       What? Do you work your Warner Bros. or something?
     * tOmy`
       It would be, but “spoilers spoilers”: We can pretty much look it
       up, because this is tied into the Rebels shit, innit?
       So basically if that show established some of these characters or
       already dropped a hint about Mara Jade, we can figure it out.
       But yea, I am still with you on this: It would be a cool twist.
     * Doctor Andre Son of Thomas.
       Realistically it depends on who Rey is. if she is Lukes kid then it
       has to be Mara because they have to milk mama… so to speak.

     * Skewed_View
       Damn you, Max Landis! Several people commenting on Rogue One’s
       teaser calling the lead a “Mary Sue.” Why did you have to introduce
       that term?
       You can’t tell anything about her from the teaser, all you know is
       she’s a trouble maker. So “Mary Sue” apparently means Star Wars
       girls, or just female protagonist.
     * Doctor Andre Son of Thomas.
       So she is a Homunculus?

     * Tapeworm
       Good idea. Hmm, I wonder where’s the nearest parking lot…
     * tOmy`
       Well, that sorta happens when she is one of the main characters of
       your favorite Star Wars book trilogy, pretty interesting one for
       that matter and also a protagonist of the game you excessively
       played throughout your childhood.

     * Sully
       Max Landis didn’t invent “Mary Sue.” He merely made it a meme.
     * Skewed_View
       That’s what I meant, that he introduced it to the masses.

       I mean shit, check out her resume: Emperor’s right hand, currently
       working for a “new Han Solo” of Thrawn Trilogy, cynical asshole,
       bad-ass pilot, slightly trained in Force AND onto a mission to

       Nah, not so much. She is good at doing her job, but that’s about

       Trilogy, which sorta makes her the most interesting addition to the
       fold.

       Timothy Zahn done a pretty awesome job with both the established
       characters and the new additions. I wouldn’t mind seeing Talon
       Karrde and definitely wouldn’t mind seeing Thrawn, but I am kinda
       cautious…
       I mean, they work really well within the story that was told
       throughout those 3 books, but not sure how well would they fit into
       another story.

     * Sully
       Yeah… I know. That shit isn’t canon any more though. I think she’s
       Luke’s kid. With the internet speculation train in full force,
       there’s no way they can blow people away like they did with the
       original Luke/Vader revelation, so why try? They’d end up running
       from fan theories and right into ridiculous territory à la Lost.
       Just make the story make sense and reach an emotional resolve.
     * Sully
       They’d have to create a parallel cinematic universe that took place
       during the events of the original trilogy without really dealing
       with those core hero characters. It could be done, but I don’t
       think anyone at Disney is willing to take that leap.
       It would be cool though.
     * Tapeworm
       Mate, I value my experiences of the art and the story. I love

     * tOmy`
       Well, they can pretty much plop him into any of the spin-offs. He
       was just a general before the end of ROTJ and nobody heard about
       him, so while he wasn’t technically in the movie, he might have
       been around, doing his job. There was no need for him to even
       appear in the film.
       So it wouldn’t be totally plot-breaking to have him suddenly be a
       part of some spin-off where Rebels fight whatever wherever.

       The trailer was okay. What else would you like expect considering
       the first initial reaction to the TFA was almost near universal

       journalism and ‘tech’:
       Yahoo’s billion-person-a-month home page is run by an algorithm,
       with a spare editorial staff, that pulls in the best-performing
       content from across the site. Yahoo engineers generally believed
       that these big names should have been able to support themselves,
       garner their own large audiences, and shouldn’t have relied on
       placement on the home page to achieve large audiences. As a result,
       they were expected to sink or swim on their own.
       Understandably, this bred some resentment within the newsroom, as
       writers with large egos and paychecks found themselves awash in a
       sea of lower-level content. Some writers felt “you could almost
       never find them because Kim Kardashian’s ass is so large it just
       pushed them off into the margin,” as one former staff member told
       me.

       Too sharp.
       Combined with fake shakey cam.
       Also… there’s that “splash page” tendency in it.
       Characters just standing there, in the middle of the shot, looking
       awesome. Doesn’t look like scenes from a movie… more like a fashion
       show.
       Also… Main character feels “off” compared to everyone else.
       In that old promo shot where everyone was wearing fake unnecessary
       dirt and soot on their faces, she kinda fit in.

       In the trailer… she is too… artificial.
       She is too made-up, with all that eyeliner, lips too pouty, teeth
       too perfect, hair always perfectly parted… and then they show you
       Forest Whitaker who on his best day still looks genuinely banged up
       due to that eye of his.
       She stands out in a bad way.
       And she is too petite.
       Luke was “a little short for a storm trooper” – she is 15
       centimeters shorter, but supposedly she’ll fit right into that
       uniform.
       At least in Hunger Games it was clear that the main character was
       there for propaganda purposes only.
       AND JLaw is those 15 centimeters taller.
       And at least there’s no Zatoichi for the Asian market in those
       movies.
       Did I say Zatoichi? I meant that other guy.

       So, will the RLM crew review this one, and will they end up
       inexplicably liking it like they did TFA – which came as a surprise
       to me. It surprised me that a group of film dorks that spent hours
       and hours dissecting the prequel movies to death liked TFA which
       while not an explosion of embarrassing nonsense like the prequels –
       was a powerpoint presentation of corporate goals in film production
       translated to the screen as lifeless dreck.
       Rogue One comes off as more of the same – I think even the more
       enthusiastic reviews for it, like TFA will within a weeks time go
       from “It’s the best!” to “Well, it was alright. I suppose.”
       Also from the sound of it I was sort of hoping we’d get a war movie
       in Star Wars, that might be interesting instead of yet another
       hero(ine)’s journey.

       literally couldn’t give a fuck about any of them because I had no
       clue as to who they were, or if I should like or dislike them.
       Compare that to the characters in Goodfellas, I was genuinely upset

       We came a long way from that “we want to make adult war movie set

       Mickey Mouse came around and started lashing them for trying to get
       creative.

       Well, “they cannot be undone” comes to mind.
       Afterall, they even referenced them in TFA, so they will always be
       a part of this universe. You know, till someone stops giving a fuck

       It’s really that simple. We could argue all year about what
       character X would do, or how this or that could be better, but the
       simple fact is that the movie works. It is a heroine’s journey.
       There is a protagonist, she has a character arc. There are
       emotional moments. There are jokes. To reiterate, the movie works.
       Maybe it was assembled in a corporate boardroom by a bunch of evil
       Jew, hippie, feminazi cyborgs from the Chthulu dimension. Don’t
       know. Don’t care. The point is that it was a successful reboot of a

       Not really true man.
       Lucas got the colors and the camera right.
       These Disney movies all feel too sharp, too snappy, too
       artificially blurred and actioned up, too gritty… and even with
       nearly no fuckin sand in them.
       Also, they are all taking the bold and brave path of copying the
       original trilogy, only with modern technology.
       Which, again, makes the results feel fake and plastic and cheap
       cause everything is too fucking perfect. Down to lead
       actors/actresses who are all models with perfect teeth, who look
       like they never had a pockmark or a blemish on their perfect faces,
       who look well fed, pampered and generally like they have nothing to
       rebel about.
       Which in turn makes Lucas come off as a fuckin visionary.
       Cause his CGI just looks like badly aged CGI. His hired artists
       knew where to stop and where to blemish.
       And apart from the kid in the Episode 1 and Hotpants Padame…
       everyone looks like they’ve actually lived SOME kinda imperfect
       life.
       Fuckin cartoons in the prequels look less cartoony than the actors
       in the Disney movies.

       trendy electronic music and pushes it through intricate production,
       creating couple of interesting experimental tracks. 7,5/10

       Mogwai way. Feel free to start throwing all them nerdy words
       describing this particular genre, I am just gonna go with
       underwhelmingly epic collection of songs rather than an actual

       I know a lot of people say the New Star Wars as a cynical corporate
       vehicle to sell products. But that’s what Star Wars has always been
       about. Did George Lucas ever say once “I have so much integrity and
       dignity that i will never use my creation sell a single toy, comic,
       bedsheets, pajamas and underwear.” Imagine if Stanley Kubrick said
       “You know what we need. A 2001 playset for all the kiddies.” Ever
       God damn time theres a new Star Wars movie. Its merchandising
       bonanza. And yes that includes all our warm and fuzzy feeling about
       the Original trilogy. Marvel already published a Star Wars comic a
       mouth before the 1977 movie came out. And Kenner was selling empty
       box, giving kids the hope of owning toys when they came out. I mean
       sure the original trilogy is great. But lets not kid oursleves.

       The teen allegedly stole the Jordan Retro 8 sneakers and walked

       Sam managed to make it only about 100 yards with the shoes when the

       teenager was pinned against the fence and his right arm was severed

       I think I understand your comment, in that the only time Lucas
       seemed to make a big fuss was with the Cantina characters. Kenner
       was making executive decisions on how certain characters looked,
       and rather blindly. I think one toy had its feet chopped because
       the character was sitting at the bar and you couldn’t see the feet
       to know. Lucas had a fit about 2 other characters, too. Hence,
       Lucas’ involvement later on.

       CGI don’t care if an actual camera placed at that angle would show
       ALL THAT with the available lighting.
       If you don’t tell computer to NOT render the details that should
       not be visible… it will render them if you’ve built them in.
       On the other hand, hand-made model has both a limitation to how
       detailed it can be AND it must obey the laws of optics.
       Specifically, camera’s optics.

       I should have posted it under the original comment about SW being
       about selling shit to kids from the start. The point was that the
       toys were there to sell the movie first, because Lucas thought
       studio isn’t marketing it properly.

       Ahh. From what I understand, the standard for toy selling at the
       time was merchandising would come out up to a year after the movie
       came out. It rarely synced with a movie’s release. Shirts and
       posters were early to the game, but anything else didn’t usually
       show up on shelves until Christmas, regardless of when the movie
       came out, and it was infinitesimal.
       Kenner received the toy contract just a month before the film came
       out after the big toy companies turned the contract down, and had
       no idea what they were selling. There was no contact with Lucas at
       that point. The movie came out on the 25th, the whole company
       watched the film on the 31st, and that’s when the “IOU” toy concept
       came up to recoup lost time.
       Kenner was also different from other toy companies in that they
       wanted toys to have multiple functions and different environments
       to play in. Lucas had a much greater say for that in Empire,
       because he sent models to the company while the film was being
       made. However, Kenner was most responsible for selling a movie
       using toys that actually did things, rather than just little dolls.
       Other companies didn’t do that beforehand.
       I guess Lucas could say “You’re not marketing this right,” but he
       really didn’t have any grand plans, either. That all fell on
       Kenner. That company should probably get all the praise and hate
       for making movie merchandising the way it is now, because they were
       the ones who set up a profitable template for other companies to
       follow. 🙂

       So, we just got a Star Wars movie, that looks and feels almost
       exactly like A New Hope.
       Now, we are getting a new Star Wars movie, that seems to look and
       feel almost exactly like A New Hope… again. Fuck this. I wanna see
       something different.
       Say what you will about the prequels, because I know I did, but
       they at least attempted a slightly different approach
       world-building-wise.
     * Sully
       Too bad all of that world building in the prequels deconstructed
       and shat upon the already established world that people liked from
       the OT in the first place. I will say this about Rogue One; at
       least none of the protagonists bear the surnames: Skywalker, Solo,
       or Kenobi. So that’s refreshing.
     * Domo
       For the longest time I thought “I’ll just watch the episode stuff,
       but ignore Rogue One through Forty.” Oddly enough, Rogue One
       intrigues me. It feels more rough around the edges while being
       visually captivating. If TFA was Captain America: The First
       Avenger, Rogue One feels like Captain America: Winter Soldier. To
       me, at least.

       That’s probably the most appropriate comparison I’ve heard (read).
     * Like Icare
       Nah… they are not doing that.
       “That” being the thing where Marvel division of Disney plays the
       game of “I see things I recognize” with Marvel characters, themes
       and storylines.
       Star Wars division is playing the same game – with original
       trilogy.
       No prequels, no EU (because money and royalties), new characters
       mixing with old things audiences know and recognize.
       Final goal of both versions of the game is hoarding as much money
       as possible.
       Thus, according to the “I see things I recognize” rules, they can
       only do “things I recognize” with episodes IV to VI.
       And since they can’t really redo the entire episode IV AGAIN…
       It’s episode IV with elements of episode V.
       Thus, AT-AT walkers attacking a secret base WHICH IS NOT the secret
       base from episode IV, and since Rogue One is a prequel…
       It’s Hoth retreat all over again, only in a tropical setting.
       Meanwhile, a new character joins the rebellion and is being made
       into a hero blah-blah… someone will die (I’m lookin at you –
       Zaotichi)… there will be a battle… and the hero will “go rogue” in
       order to back-setup the events of the episode IV.
       So they rhyme.
       And everyone ends up on Yavin.
       If we’re lucky, everyone shown in that movie will DIE.
       If not so lucky… we get a side-story or two where younger (CGI)
       versions of OT characters interact with these new characters (which
       will suck) in order for Disney Trilogy characters to be created.
       I.e. There will be babies.
       And they will live on Millennium Falcon and shake hands with each
       other.
     * [1706]instant relief
       Granted, but we get to see the Death Star again for the umpteenth

       I don’t mind it in this instance because the Death Star, as well as
       Mon, are relevant to the story they want to tell and, cash grab or
       not, it’s a story I’ve wanted to see on the big screen since the
       80s. I’ve always been intrigued by the mission of the rebels who
       had the balls to infiltrate the Empire and steal the plans to the
       greatest weapon in the galaxy. To me the rebels were always more
       interesting than the Jedi.

       So I just finished watching Inherent Vice, a movie so convoluted
       and complicated you have to remember up to five names and try not
       to get distracted for 150 minutes by the lack of explosions.
       Sure, the writing is purposefully ramped up to 11 due to this thing
       called “buuk” that came out before this more user-friendly piece of
       medium, so you gonna have to sit through some dialogues that use
       more than two syllables long words and are not greenscreened right
       onto your eyeball, but all in all, the movie is certainly not that
       offensive towards general lack of literacy and intellect.
       Far out, 9/10.

       I was in that movie. Did you know that?
     * Like Icare
       You make it sound like it is too smart for the audiences. It’s not.
       It’s just… convoluted.
       AAAAnd… it feels wrong.
       For two reasons.
       One – some books don’t lend themselves to film making. Particularly
       the wordy ones, where much of what is said is in the words – not in
       the images those words might describe.
       There’s a handy line in THGTTG that illustrates this.
       “He inched his way up the corridor as if he would rather be yarding
       his way down it, which was true.”
       That line is funny. Image of that… not much.
       Main character in Inherent Vice movie is called Larry “Doc”
       Sportello. That’s a funny name…
       The other reason is the time frame.
       That movie should feel like a counter-culture ’70s flick. It
       doesn’t.
       It feels like a shinier and glossier episode of Life on Mars. Play
       pretend ’70s.
       Which works for Boogie Nights cause that one is parodying a certain
       ’70s subculture. It’s painting a picture. A funny one.
       Inherent Vice is supposed to be painting a REALISTIC picture and
       then pointing a finger at stuff on it making you go “Damn. That
       shit is fucked up crazy.”
       MAYBE had the director been someone like Terry Gilliam (but the one
       who did Fear and Loathing – not the one who made Zero Theorem), who
       would understand the relation of the inner symbolism of the book
       with real ’70s and with today, and who could then create something
       out of it… maybe a movie could be made that’s any good.
       This one has cool posters though.
       Too bad there’s no such movie.
       Oh, and Owen Wilson shouldn’t have been allowed anywhere near it.

       “You make it sound like it is too smart for the audiences.”
       I was obviously joking and being hyperbolic due to the popularity
       of people calling it “hard to understand” and “too many names to
       remember”.
       That move ain’t smarter than your usual PI detective story, it only
       appears that way because it doesn’t do that much of hand holding
       (although it does some) and because of the over-stylized narration
       that I assume is taken directly from the book.
       So yea, my joke aside, I didn’t have many problems with the movie
       itself and it actually made me look up the book because I want to
       read it now and see how is it different.

       Ah you know… Poe’s law and all that.
       I personally don’t think that it is hard to understand… it’s just…
       there isn’t really anything TO understand.
       It doesn’t really follow a plot – thus one of the reasons it feels
       to me like the guy who made Fear and Loathing could have made it
       work. That movie also doesn’t really have a plot.
       As for the book… I got too many of those “Best writer ever!” about
       Thomas Pynchon that I really can’t make myself to try an pick up
       something by him.
       Same goes for David Foster Wallace. Coelho. Salinger.
       Every time I pick up one of those “Best writer ever!” guys it turns
       out to be… nothing special.
       Speaking of David Foster Wallace, if you want to get the urge to
       kill yourself (as he did) watch The End of the Tour.
       Nearly two hours of Jason Segel and Jesse Eisenberg being passive
       aggressive, anxious and borderline something-or-other while
       Eisenberg’s character is envious and needy towards the guy whom
       he’s remembering after his (DFW’s) suicide – and how envious and
       needy he was of him back then.

       I don’t think he’s Tarkin. He’s just the villain of the week. These
       movies need baddies to kill, but since they can’t kill Tarkin or
       Vader, and regular stormtroopers don’t count for much, they’ve
       cooked up a new villain just so he can be ‘ploded in the end and
       audiences can scream, “Yay!” at the movie screen and not feel too
       bad when most of the good guys don’t make it out alive.

       We really don’t get much of an ending out of it and basically only

       is just sorta… there, occupying the space and moving on.

       BvS only did early screenings the week before it was released and
       the reactions then were about as they are now; either “Greatest
       shit ever!” or “Uh oh.” Whenever a studio waits that long to
       release the film to critics it’s typically a sign that the studio
       isn’t confident in their product.
       This film is still a month away, and I’ve yet to see a bad review.
       The most scathing review I saw was, “Is it perfect? No. But it’s
       far better than Age of Ultron, so there’s that.”

       The Russo’s seem pretty competent. Plus the luxury of having duel

       when you think about there’s some sad similarities here. I mean

       to cash in.
     * Sully
       The Russo’s were getting similar reactions to Winter Soldier. I
       think they’ve proven they can tell a compelling story while still
       maintaining the action and humor to keep the kids in their seats.
       The biggest worry most people were having in regards to Civil War
       seemed to revolve around the sheer size of the roster they were
       working with this time, but everyone seems to approve of their use
       of the characters in the film. Also, not all of the reviews are
       professional, some fans got early access as well and their
       responses have been equally positive.
     * NicCagesHair
       Is a Baldur’s Gate game really something to get worked up about?

     * dollar store cashier wife
       Aside from the roster the problem for me is the inherently stupid
       VS premise. Batman vs Superman,Captain Murrica vs Iron Asshole. You
       just know they’ll be back to being BFF’s one movie later with no
       consequences of previous events. The Winter Solider is my favorite
       MCU movie. I think it owes a large part in that mindless action was
       not one of it’s selling points even if the movie did ended in non
       stop action filled 3rd act just like all these movies.

       So there is this song on the new Pet Shop Boys album called “The
       Pop Kids”. I am absolutely stoked about this song, because it has a
       nice retro thumbing sound with chorus that goes like this:
       “They called us the pop kids / Cuz we loved the pop hits / And
       quoted the best bits” which is all kinds of hysterical. But one
       thing struck me a bit odd, because at the end, the singers sings
       “And I loved youuuu”. So I actually went back to properly recheck
       the lyrics and found out that this song is about some particular ex
       singer banged back in the 80s.
       And something very bittersweet crossed my mind: Here you have a
       couple of aging guys, desperately trying to stay relevant and fresh
       enough for people to love them, yet they still find time to write
       convoluted (and itsy bitsy cringeworthy) song about a girl the
       singer used to date, depicting their whole history in a very
       bio-pic fashion, acknowledging how much he used to love her. Here
       is a part of me hoping that if this is a true story, I kinda hope
       this girl gets to hear this song and it makes her day.
       I kinda like music, guys. (Review pending)

       Hence me thinking they will reverse it and kill off Tony.

       Would sure be neat. So far the only time they dared to kill off a
       good guy was that fucking one dimensional clown Agent Coulson…and
       he was the entire emotional core of The Assvengers.

       Cap will kiss Tony and he’ll come back to life. At least that’s
       what happens in every MCU fanfiction ever written.
     * Tapeworm
       There’s a wiki editor that needs some assurance that his feelings
       towards the concept of penis are temporary.
     * tOmy`
       Yea, I think Tony bites it. Seeing that Black Panther will be
       “important” movie when it comes to MCU plot and they are already
       setting up Cap Marvel (who is like one of the most important ones
       in Infinity War), I assume we are getting close to discarding the
       old guard.

       for character over action, and since they’re also doing the
       Infinity War movies, I’d be willing to bet we see some of the

       Skywalker’. In 1979, this idea disappeared down the memory hole.
       The first film became Episode IV, with the subtitle ‘A New Hope’ —
       which was added to the opening crawl for the theatrical re-release

       So Avengers: Age of Ultron was good. Not as good as the first one,

       You’ve given almost every MCU film a 7/10 as far as I can tell.
       Were there any truly great movies or misfires? Age of Ultron was
       one of the worst in my opinion. It suffered from Spiderman 3
       syndrome i.e. too many characters, Iron Man 2 syndrome i.e too much
       setup for future films which no-one will care about by the time
       those films are released, was overlong despite being light on
       character development (particularly Vision) and came off contrived
       in a few places. Overall I liked the story, but it needed a good
       ten minutes or so taken out of it and at least one more scene with
       Vision.

       “Zack Snyder cut a scene from Batman V Superman for being too dark”
       For instance: Snyder recently told IGN that he cut a scene from
       near the end of the film because it “sort of represented this dark
       side.” The scene in question also addresses a perceived plot hole
       in the movie, from a later sequence when Clark Kent is searching
       for his kidnapped mother. Fans have pointed out that hiding things
       from Superman is tricky for anyone without easy access to a whole
       lot of lead soundproofing equipment, what with all those
       superpowers he’s always using. And, indeed, Snyder says there was
       originally a scene of Superman using his powers to search for
       Martha Kent, but which would have seen him be overwhelmed and
       distracted by nearby cries for help.

       That actually ties into something I was saying on another site.
       I proposed that it is actually cruel to put Superman into a world
       that is too real. Unlike in a comic world where bad things happen
       at the behest of the story, in the real world bad things are
       happening constantly. Given Superman’s powers he would be aware of
       them all the time and would have to make choices of who dies and
       who lives on a daily, even hourly basis. Even to get a good night’s
       sleep or have dinner with Lois he would have to ignore people in
       peril. He would either go insane or become completely jaded to
       human misery.

       To be fair… that’s the journalist being snarky.
       Snyder on the other hand is just being… dumb and unintellectual.
       It’s a question someone like him should never address.
       He should leave it to people like Nolan, who’ve dealt with
       philosophy.
       Someone who could address the whole “If he’s so powerful why didn’t
       he save my cat?” (substitute cat for mother if you’d like) issue –
       by making it clear that just like everyone else Superman has
       limits.
       While the world does not.
       Eventually, people DO die.
       [1849]https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QUUGDRxJnFU
       Cats too.
       So… With all that power do you wallow in your own self pity and
       powerlessness to save everyone, do you go nihilistic cause what’s
       the point of it all with heat death of the universe happening
       eventually, do you jump around all the time trying to be everywhere
       at once until you burn out cause an ant broke a leg somewhere while
       the Moon was crushing down on the Earth…
       Or do you realize that just like police are not issued
       thermonuclear weapons or even napalm – all that power is there for
       bigger things than stopping muggings and chasing down shoplifters.
       And that, when it’s shown to the world that MAYBE, just maybe,
       there is someone out there making sure that the sky doesn’t fall –
       maybe everyone else can take a break from some of all that
       existential anxiety, drop some of that nihilism and get some of
       those fucking cats from those fucking trees.

       So I just watched 10 Cloverfield Lane. I was really excited to see
       this movie because it got great reviews and even the Hack Frauds On
       High seemed to like it. Plus I’m a huge sci-fi/horror fan.
       I watched a screener (which I normally don’t do), so maybe that had
       some effect, but I actually thought it was kinda meh. John
       Goodman’s character was terrible in every sense of the word. He was
       crazy because the script told him to be. There are certain scenes
       that were unintentionally hilarious with him. I was very often
       like, “Is he being serious? Is this a joke? Is this supposed to be
       tense?”
       The other two characters felt pretty cookie cutter as well. They
       got the appropriate time to develop, I guess, but what they
       developed into was as bland as a cracker sandwich. Plus, as others
       already mentioned, the ending of the movie is completely given away
       in the title. Which destroyed 95% of the tension for me. Then,
       *SPOILERS*, the main character destroys a giant flying alien squid
       with an improvised molotov cocktail. Wut? What really killed it for
       me though, was the very ending, when she’s driving off in the car
       and hears a distress call from some assholes somewhere. All I could
       think was, “I’d rather watch THAT movie.” I’m sure the Hollywood
       money machine will grant my wish…
       5/10 Just average. Catch it on Netflix.

       I’m sorry the lead I offered didn’t pan out.
       I supposed that if there was no one on the production even trying
       to stand up for the story, the book would have had to be more a
       story of mismanagement than artistic conflict. Or maybe none of its
       artists were talking.
       The artistry of it would have been more interesting. Cases in
       point: Randall Wallace’s commentary for We Were Soldiers and
       Michael Patrick King’s commentaries for Sex & the City (the
       series). Always informative.
       There’s actually a sub-genre of book, whose authors advise how to
       co-exist with the defective process of art-by-committee, e.g.:
       The Monologue Audition – Karen Kohlhaas, (one of Mamet’s second

       What is this? Ew. Get it away from me!
     * Hank_Henshaw
       This sounds like it could be like the Simpsons Spin-off Showcase.
       But I guess they know what they are doing. They just can’t have A)
       Jesse interacting with Mike, Saul, etc. B) have it take place in
       the present, as Aaron Paul looks almost nothing like he looked like
       back in BrBa season 1.
     * [1868]instant relief
       Ooh, so BvS is a misunderstood homage.
     * [1869]Boss Ninja
       Ah Care Boars with it’s 27.000.000 views. RLM strongest IP.

       Didn’t like AoU that much. It’s ok. Then again, I didn’t like IM3
       much either.
     * Hank_Henshaw
       So, I was watching a youtube video of a Spaniard reviewing BvS:
       DOA. He mostly talked about how Luthor’s plan didn’t make a lick of
       sense. His ridiculing of Eisenberg’s ticks and performance as
       Luthor was amusing. What was best though, was when he said that
       despite the movie claiming to be mature/adult superhero movie, it
       ultimately came across like dressing a baby with a leather jacket.
       It doesn’t actually make the baby look more mature, it makes him
       look sillier.

       You never know if Disney provided them with an advanced copy, as
       some sort of viral marketing thing. A Plinkett review would
       certainly boost the blu ray sales, and that movie needs all the
       help it can get.
     * Hank_Henshaw
       I bet Snyder thinks that baby looks “cool” and “badass”.

       No. It’s still horseshit. This is a record.

       In my opinion, the new review might very well still be in the
       scripting stages. Then he needs to record the skit bits, edit the
       whole thing. I think people expecting TFA’s review to drop soon are
       in for disappointment.
       I might be wrong though.
     * Palpatine
       Ba-dum-tss!

       Yea, I would be surprised if it dropped before winter. And even
       more surprised if it didn’t get taken down hours later.

       The “S” is the symbol of Hope on Superman’s planet. Zack Snyder
       interprets it as “I hope don’t have to do anything to help those
       puny bugs”.

       He saw TMNT and Secret of the Ooze in one sitting. That may screw
       with your mind, especially if you’re a space Toad and know the TMNT
       had a beef with the Battletoads.

       Watching Season 7 of TNG; I think the budget for the entire season
       was the same as Space Cop’s production. Who’s bright idea was it to
       have officer conflict as a motif?

       Didn’t Zack Snyder direct 300? This joke has, like layers… and
       shit.
     * Hank_Henshaw
       The “S” being anything other than a freaking “S” is a Donner
       invention. I think it came about because Brando demanded to be seen
       wearing the S, so they had to come up with something. An S being
       the House of El crest, gave us Zod’s crest being an stylized “Z”,
       or Faora’s and “F”, which is very stupid.
       Mark Waid’s Birthright (which introduced the “hope” concept) and
       Geoff John’s Secret Origin later adopted the “House of El” crap. In
       the Golden Age and Silver Age, Jor-El’s symbol was a sun. Byrne’s
       Jor-El had nothing.
       Thank you, Brando. You done fucked up.

       NO THANKS! I don’t have time anyway. I’m currently watching the
       collected works of Chris Farley. Boy the movies suck, specially the
       ones with Spade but Farley is still a lot of fun. And after this
       I’m having a long Kurosawa fest. And as I’ve said before 2016 has
       not much going for it movie wise for me. That means more time to
       discover gems from the past.
       Plus. I think I’ll just stop watching sup.movies for now(ever). I
       hate them generally anyway. I’m not watching anything from Snyder
       verse or the Marvel circus. EVER! BvS was such a weird creation no
       one can really ignore. Plus Cosby gets put to good use on BN.
       I will see a Dredd movie if they’d make one and Nolan really made
       everything I need to be satisfied Batman wise. I’m at peace with
       the universe.

       Kylo’s saber actually made me extremely happy. After f*cking
       decades of people getting their hands chopped off, SOMEONE actually
       thought to put a guard on that damn thing. Good call, Kylo.
       Kylo had some sweet moves in his duels with Rey and Finn. He used
       both parry 9 and parry 6, which is pretty fancy shit. I’ve only
       ever pulled off parry 6 in a bout, and that was only once.
       I always pay attention to bladework in movies. The Luke/Vader fight
       scene in Empire was actually choreographed by a fencing master, and
       you can tell. Vader uses parry five on Luke’s first attack, and
       then uses a gorgeous circle parry to disarm him.

       Oh, the bladework in the prequels is just flawless.
       My fencing instructor drilled four things into me when I first
       started fencing.
       1) Swing at your opponent’s blade, not at their body
       2) If you can’t hit their blade, cut the air
       3) Use your arm more than your wrist when making cuts
       4) Always show your back to your opponent, so you can leave
       yourself in a vulnerable position.
       All of the above was used to perfection during the “Duel of Fates”
       or whatever.

       “One of the most universal behaviors in the furry fandom is the
       creation of a fursona – an anthropomorphic animal representation or
       avatar. More than 95% of furries have a fursona – an
       anthropomorphic avatar or representation of themselves. Nearly half
       of furries report that they have only ever had one fursona to
       represent themselves; relatively few furries have had more than
       three or four fursonas; in part, this is due to the fact that, for
       many furries, their fursonas are a personally significant,
       meaningful representation of their ideal self”

       Do I have to?
     * tOmy`
       I am no expert, but if I remember correctly, pansexuals are above
       the concept of gender; meaning they will fuck whomever, girl or a
       boy, whomever.
       For them, attraction is the key aspect.
       Bisexuals on the other hand know when they fancy a penis more than
       a squishbox and the other way around.
       That is why are pansexuals often referred to as “genderblind”, for
       them, the whole concept of gender goes out of the window. As long
       as there is an attraction, they go for it.
       Bisexual can still feel like (s)he would rather take a dick for the
       rest of the life. For example, I have a bi friend who spent half of
       her life dating boys and now she settled down with a girl because
       it feels more right.
       As I said, I am no expert, so you can look up some pretty neat
       videos by pansexuals on the YouTube, explaining how their brain
       works. It’s kinda interesting.

       You don’t start your life as straight and then decide to go
       lesbian. Remember that whole “it’s not a choice” narrative? If you
       are into both, you are bi. If she would “turn” lesbian… well, that

       It’s kinda great, because it suffers from a lot of similar issues.
       I mean hell, I heard that the book is better, so I’ll give it some
       benefit of a doubt, but you can just see one movie aping the
       romantic style (and the lack of it) of the other one.
       The absolute confusion about romance, sex and desire, transformed
       into some PG13 clusterfuck with emotionless drones absolutely and
       utterly missing the premise. And it is also kinda disturbing.
     * tOmy`
       Harry Potter has at least an idea that somewhat manifests itself

       notice in the written form and / or wouldn’t care about that much.

       I think the 80s were pretty unique for theme songs/soundtracks.
       It’s like every movie had one. Sometimes the songs were arguably
       better than the movie itself. Like the Bowie song for the Cat
       People movie. Songs only seldom get made for movies now. Though
       maybe Will Smith will do a song for Suicide Squad like he did for
       Men In Black and Wild Wild West.

       – SPOILERS – Ending of “The Night Manager”
       The show was fantastic…except for the ending. The MI6 agent spent
       years going after Roeper and she’s okay with letting the Arabs give
       him a “rough ride” (so much for the moral high ground). If that’s
       the way she feels about it, if he “deserves it”, why spend years of
       espionage getting Roeper indicted? Why not simply hire someone to
       shoot him in the fucking head? That “villains death” really lowered
       the bar for a show that was so suspenseful and addicting up to that
       point, which pretty much shattered my suspension of disbelief. It
       was a mellow (cliche) ending for an otherwise brilliant BBC
       production.

       Anyway, don’t worry man. I agree that reviewing old favourites can
       be boring, but as current music progresses, so does our view of
       past music. And every generation has to discover the old music,
       which means that it keeps renovating. The fact that Lady Gaga
       exists must affect Beethoven, in some way.

       Tonight at 23:00 CET (4:30 from now) TheManhole will stream the
       ever so amazing Fast Five!
       When you are going against the most powerful man in Rio, you better
       assemble a team of superheroes! This time around, your favorite
       rascals join forces with Han (who is still alive, for some reason),
       hot chick on the bike you forgot was in the previous one, two
       unsubtitled Mexicans and two black guys, who will live to steal
       another day!
       So settle up for the staple vault scene, that happens after 100
       minutes of heist planning, talking about family and defying all
       known laws of gravity, traction and acting, in a movie that
       desperately wants to you to forget that this was somehow a racing
       franchise, while our main heroes murder cops, endanger lives of
       hundreds of civilians, endanger pregnant woman and still somehow
       come off as “the good guys”.
       RPGs! Militarized police! Corruption! Sexism! The Rock and cars
       being better actors than the core squad! And lots and lots of cars
       going fast and furious!

       Superman doesn’t have to be boring, though. That’s the issue I have
       with him. Christopher Reeve’s Superman worked so well because he
       played him as both passionate about helping people, but also a
       little arrogant, though in that likable/nice guy kinda way. I
       actually think Cavill could play a solid Kal El, you could see
       hints of it in MoS, but Snyder keeps directing him to be a mopey
       asshole, which is just a turnoff to the character.

       Welp, I finally hunkered down and watched BvS with my friends a few
       days ago (don’t worry, Snyder didn’t get a cent from us).
       We ended up having a gay ol’ time and were laughing through most of
       the movie. The Knightmare scene in particular had us howling like
       coyotes. I had had more of the movie spoiled for me compared to the
       two of them, so it was really fun to see their reactions when
       Batman murdered with wild abandon and their sheer confusion at the
       numerous dream sequences.
       Perhaps because I already knew so much about it going in, it
       actually didn’t bother me all that much. I think it’s definitely a
       worse movie in many respects than MoS, both as a film and an
       adaptation, but it never once annoyed me on the same levels that
       did. It was like experiencing the punchline to a big joke.
       But perhaps because I already knew so much about it going in, I
       ended up feeling nothing after it was done. I can’t visually
       remember or recall anything from that film. It was like a blank
       space that left no impact on me. All the build-up and pomp, and I
       ultimately took nothing away from it when it was done.

       For $900 mill globally, they’d have to be making less than $1
       million average daily, globally, for the next 16 weeks, which is
       the lowest possible number of weeks it will be playing.
       Domestic alone doesn’t fall to $1 mill until week 5.
       Right now it’s week 3.
       [2222]http://www.boxofficemojo.com/showdowns/chart/?view=daily&id=s
       uperherosmackdown.htm
       Domestic being about 40% of global, and taking that as the estimate
       of that global $1 mill point – that’s point is around week 7 or 8.
       Assuming it will be making peanuts when it passes the below $1 mill
       point, taking in about $7-8 million total domestic until the end of
       the run, and dividing the rest of the money it needs to make over
       the next 4 weeks – with that money being about 40% of the global
       take.
       It needs about $24-25 mill weekly domestic for the next 4 weeks
       (including this one – which is at about $23+ mill ATM) to secure
       that
       $1B global score.
       To secure $900 mill globally, it only needs to be making ~14
       million domestically for the next 4 weeks – and it’s already gonna
       cover 50-70% of that by the end of this week.
       I mean… it’s crossing $800 mill globally in a day or two… and then
       it’s still months more that it is slowly making money.

     * Palpatine
       So out of complete boredom, I deiced to come up with an idea for a
       horror film I might write. It has your basic setup for a ghost
       story. A family of five moves into an old mansion and paranormal
       things start to occur. Or do they? It turns out the middle child is
       schizophrenic and only he can see the “ghosts” that reside in the
       house. Are they ghosts, or are they merely figments of the boys
       disturbed mind? The parents think it’s his schizophrenia, but his
       older brother, who’s logical most of the time, starts think his
       brother is really seeing the ghosts of people who’ve previously
       lived in the mansion. As for the ghosts themselves, there are four
       of them, and they have a “family” of sorts. A “father”, a “mother”,
       and “two sons”. But know all they need is a “youngest daughter” to
       complete their “family”. And their asking the boy to kill his
       younger sister to complete the family. I dunno, it’s not very
       original, and it’s a lot like The Shining. But tell me what you
       guys think anyway.

       So… what’s up with all the time delay on all the new stuffs?

       I have started to write Spoi Lers: A Star Wars Story. A film made
       to be made by Neil Breen. With out spoiling the opening narration
       explains how he, Jedi Master Spoi Lers, survived Order 66 and how
       good at stuff he is. The Empire doesn’t dare hunt him down because
       he has seven bombs on seven of the Imperial’s grandest ships. He
       doesn’t live off much. All he needs is some instant muffins and his
       speeder.

       Continuation can mean a lot of things. In an ideal world, the movie
       will pick up right after Indy survives a nuclear bomb blast in a
       lead-lined fridge. He’s in a hospital bed, dying from radiation
       poisoning in a full body cast. It’s revealed to the audience that
       he dreamed almost the entire last movie. He laments that he didn’t
       get to go on one last adventure. Then, just before he dies, he
       looks square into the camera and curses George Lucas.

       Pet Shop Boys – Super: Might as well called it ‘Groovy’, amirite?
       Anyway. Are you folks familiar with the band Duran Duran? They had
       this comeback album called Red Carpet Massacre that is all sorts of
       glorious, especially because it has Timbaland production and
       fucking rapping, and it is a great, yet baffling testament to the
       old dinosaurs somehow getting this shit right. It’s a 100m sprint
       towards modern genres and all the stumbles and faceplants are kinda
       adorable. And that is exactly how Super feels.
       During the first 50 seconds, I was semi-disappointed in the very
       up-to-date EDM sound, but once the singing starts and all the retro
       influences creep back down the line, it becomes utterly fun album
       full of charm, feelings and discoballs. It did lose me somewhere
       around the middle and dragged me back in with Sad Robot World
       (actual title), but all in all, while not flawless, the songs that
       stand out do fucking stand out. If it doesn’t put at least a smile
       on your face, then you have no soul. 8/10
       Deftones – Gore: The new deftones album by the deftones band called
       Deftones has all the deafening tones of the deftones genre,
       sprinkled with deftones singing and deftones guitars. It is also
       utterly, utterly unremarkable. This fucking album (already hailed
       as the best Deftones album ever) is the reason of my review delay,
       because I was desperately trying to find out what to say about it.
       I have nothing. I heard this album 4 times and I vaguely remember
       that the fourth (or was it the fifth?) song is slower and that’s
       it. Oh, yea, and it opens with the most deftones sound ever. So
       yea…
       I guess if you are a fan, you will find this album as fantastic as
       almost every other person I heard so far, but for me it just left
       this hazy, murky memory of hearing sounds I already know and heard.
       Meh. 6.5/10

       “Warner Bros. to launch Hanna-Barbera cinematic universe with

       Warner Bros. shared these plans at CinemaCon 2016, as part of a
       sizzle reel for the Warner Animation Group (WAG). Only the barest
       of glimpses of the new adventures of Scooby-Doo and the gang was
       given, though we do know that the title is S.C.O.O.B., so maybe the
       reboot will see the Mystery Machine traded in for something more
       like the Zephyr One. The studio, which is still trying to get a
       handle on the DC Extended Universe and the varying tones of its
       movies, didn’t proffer much info on how new crossovers between The
       Flintstones and The Jetsons would work.

       which I’ve heard makes the film even better.

       r=Civil War is the thirteenth overall Marvel Movie =1
       s=Civil War is great because it’s q and r

       great despite being q and r, it’s great because it’s q and r
       ~p^q^r=>p^q^r

       If any of you are comic book/Tales From the Crypt/EC fans, the guys
       behind WNUF Halloween Special and Call Girl of Cthulhu have a
       horror anthology comic coming out. They’ve earned my love for
       making 2 fun films (haven’t seen their slasher film yet) so far,
       that despite modest budgets have made the best found footage and a
       nice Henenlotter nod (with Call Girl). Maybe you care, maybe you

       So I met this Swedish dude yesterday. I was asking him how he likes
       it here. His response was something along these lines:
       “The first difference I noticed were the fields around Prague. You
       have them so close to the city. We don’t have that in Stockholm.
       You have them closer, do you know why? Because people need to eat.
       You have real people. Nobody lives in Sweden. We don’t have real
       people.”
       I sorta thought he is doing like a metaphorical shit, but that’s
       pretty much all he said about this. Then he followed with some
       architectural lesson:
       “Have you seen the Old City in Stockholm?”
       “Yea.”
       “When was it?”
       “Like a year ago?”
       “No, no, I am asking when was it. You know, it’s an Old City. I
       want to understand your situation and your collective, so I can
       help you understand Old City. It’s not my fault. There is nothing I
       can do about Old City. I can’t fight it, but I can help you.”
       When he started offering us foursome, claiming “I can feel you all
       want it and I can help you achieve it”, we sorta backed off.

       “Anyway, this enemy droid ends up giving C-3PO the crucial
       information he carries (the whereabouts of where Admiral Ackbar is
       held in captivity) and steps out into an acid rain to deploy a
       beacon signal, saving C-3PO and dying in the process. The acid rain
       burns away his shiny exterior, revealing an original red coat
       below. C-3PO, already mentally savaged, can’t escape physically
       unharmed either—he loses an arm in a brutal set of panels, then
       takes the dead droid’s arm to remember his sacrifice (and maybe
       because he just needs another arm).”

       Ghost in the Shell 2 also has several pages of hardcore porn in the
       original version.
       And I love the explanation Shirow offered for those lesbian scenes
       in the first manga.
       Namely, that cyborgs naturally prefer gay sex cause they can plug
       in their brains together to feel what the other side is feeling
       too.
       So when there are different kinds of sexual organs and stimuli on
       the other side of the connection it messes up the feedback – while
       similar sexual organs increase the pleasure levels.
       Twice the orgasm and all that.
       Which is a very interesting idea with that whole cyber-body
       experience.

       the neck beards that still live in the mom’s basement or make a
       living by making mock video reviews for their mindless sheep to
       devour. I feel sad for you folks. It seems like you were easily
       confused about the movie. How is that even possible? Sheer
       stupidity I suppose. BTW You can’t say Batman goes around murdering
       people because he doesn’t. The whole desert scene was a dream
       genius! The chase scene where maybe someone died? Who cares? What a
       bunch of ninnies.

       My god you’re so unbelievably wrong. This movie was a tonal mess
       and a writing disaster from the get-go and only got worse as it
       went on. It tried to cram 3 different stories into one movie and
       failed so hard it’s both hilarious and sad.
       I’ll agree with you that Force Awakens was pretty great, and guess
       what – RLM liked it! They liked it because it was competent,
       focused, and made with real craft and inspiration. This was not. Or
       at least if it was, it was executed by the hack director so poorly
       that it doesn’t come across that way.
     * Variant
       I’m actually slightly offended by this Harvester guy’s post because
       like Man of Steel for some reason a second time in a row I decided
       to watch a movie RLM suffered through so that I wouldn’t have to –
       just to challenge their opinion on it. And once again every single
       thing they said was exactly how I felt during it. “No way there’s
       got to be SOME fun in the movie” is what I said to myself. And
       there wasn’t. The part where Superman and Batman fought eachother
       was actually nothing less than “gross” to me. Every time Batman hit
       Superman with the green dust and he was choking on it and he looked
       all sweaty and desperate and then in that moment Batman started
       beating his face in so hard that I expected a Sin City type scene
       to occur, and Superman’s head would just fucking explode all over
       the pavement. But I already knew the plot and that Superman was
       indestructible. And additionally in the same scene I expected to
       get a laugh out of the bathroom sink moment – it was even hard to
       get that. I expected them to both be on equal footing doing a back
       and forth thing and then Batman would just sort of tear the sink
       out of the wall and smash it over his head to knock him down. But
       Superman is crawling away, slowly, in pain, broken and basically
       dying, and Batman very slowly grunts as he pulls the sink off the
       wall and breaks it over his head. And this was starkly contrasted
       with either just earlier (or after, I can’t remember anything)
       Batman was punching Superman in his face as hard as he could and
       then the dust wore off, which was a nice visual gag (I liked the
       clank at the end that indicated punching him was no longer working)
       – but then Batman after being horribly brutal pulls a little “No,
       wait a second I didn’t mean it” right before Superman smashes him
       through the floor. This movie was miserable from start to finish. I
       hated just about everything in it. I felt bad for Ben Affleck
       because hearing him in this interview it seems like he kind of
       tried to give a shit.
     * Mark Langston
       This movie is essentially a mess from start to finish starting with
       the title that uses a colloquial “v” normally reserved for matters
       of law, i.e. Roe v. Wade. I suppose the ‘V’ was more of a
       design/marketing decision as it looked cleaner and had more oomph
       than “vs” or “vs.”
       Then there’s the “Dawn of Justice”, which is just as useless as
       “Man of Steel”. When Nolan uses the term “The Dark Knight” it’s
       symbolic of the man himself. A knight being a character of nobility
       and justice but because of Batman’s macabre demeanor he does his
       best work in the shadows. But “Dawn of Justice” means absolutely
       nothing unless Snyder’s idea of a “dawn” is to see a few so-called
       heroes’ blurry security footage that’s transferred to Wonder
       Woman’s email address.
       But the most damning of the title’s misdirection is the ideology
       that both of the men represent. You guys covered it but it’s pretty
       clear that people went to see the movie based on their own
       preconceived ideas of each character in the historical sense. Lex
       even says it, “Day versus night”. But if Man of Steel taught us
       anything is that Superman is anything but a sunny day in the park
       eating egg salad. He’s a tortured character still coming to grips
       with his powers, being both admired and admonished and still
       getting advise from his mother and dead father.
       Superman is essentially a basket case. On top of that his mother’s
       been kidnaped, which makes him nothing more than a killer robot for
       Lex, Jr., and he dies…TWICE!! Once in space by a nuclear bomb then
       again when he’s gored by Doomsday.
       Basically every character in this film is tormented by something.
       Perry from having to deal with insubordinate journalists, Martha
       and Lois from being kidnaped, Zod who’s forced to be resurrected
       and transformed into a troll and Lex who appears to be suffering
       from a very rabid case of psychosis.
       Nothing about these characters is inspiring and not a single one is
       relatable. Yes, it’s a comic book film but characters like Captain
       America, Iron Man and Ant-Man represent archetypes most people can
       easily recognize. Cap is a boy scout; the ultimate gentleman,
       Ant-Man is a loving father seeking redemption and relevance outside
       of being a criminal and Iron Man, though a billionaire, is someone
       most aspire to be: rich and powerful yet still very down-to-earth,
       quick witted and compassionate.
       With BvS I don’t see myself and/or can’t relate to ANY of the main
       characters. This, I believe, is why BvS fails. Yes, the plot is
       atrocious, the editing is horrible, the script is a complete mess,
       the acting is wooden, motivations are a confounding mess and the
       characters don’t represent their comic book-based predecessors but
       rather the downtrodden, devoid of life characters that hurts the
       most.
     * Alexandria Sanders
       I just came to the realization that the DCEU is sort of becoming
       this generation’s version of the Star Wars prequels. With the
       exception of SS, there’s at least humorous parts to it. But my
       general reaction to the prequels is the same for Man of Steel and
       BvS.. Boredom. With SS, eh. It’s ok.
       Looks like Plinket will have new material to review with each movie
       that comes out. Quite honestly that sounds amazing.
     * [2524]Heskin Radiophonic
       This film turned Zak Snyder into the Joker, burning a huge pile of
       Warner Bros money.
     * Peon
       Bad news dude…….Johnny died of colorectal cancer.
     * Matt Conley
       I don’t know why but I read your comment in Nostalgia Critic’s
       voice. I agree with you, though.
     * Farfolomew
       I actually agree partially. While I won’t say it was a great movie,
       that’s really just because I dislike comic book movies and their
       unbelievable over-the-top CGI action scenes, which this movie had
       plenty of.
       However, what I don’t abide by, and frankly what made me sick to
       see these RLM guys doing, is to berate the movie for not being just
       another fun Marvel comic book “schtick”. The Marvel-type movie is
       largely why I hate comic movies, the light-hearted Spiderman-esque
       way of making stupid unfunny quips, ragdoll CGI effects, and boring
       complex plot scenes.
       God forbid someone tries to do a fresh approach to a comic book
       movie taking it down a darker path. These RLM guys think that every
       Superman movie should be corny schlock about him rescuing kittens
       from tree or bus from a river. How substantially deep of a movie
       could that possibly fucking be? Not very, as we’ve seen with
       Supermans 3 and 4.
       They totally had an agenda going in, to hate on anything Zack
       Snyder. Man of Steel was complete crap, I’ll give them that, but
       this redeemed him in my view and unfairly got bad reviews because
       of it. I watch a lot of RLM content, most being the PreRec streams,
       and this review got under my skin more than most at the apparent
       hypocrisy. I just have no idea now, going into one of their
       reviews, whether they’ll like it or hate it when it comes to big
       Hollywood movies nowadays. They’re that inconsistent.
