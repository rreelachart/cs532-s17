       If I ended up there and they pulled a skit with the only one video
       on the wheel bit I’d have just walked outta the room when it
       started up.
       I feel like they pretend not to know about this stuff, they have
       videos like these in the hunting section of every store that sells
       guns.
     * RLMkeepitup
       why are over powered gun people usually under educated. anyhoo,

       seduce the women and children.
     * A. N. Kievsky
       Can we get an uncensored version? I’m curious about those varmints.
     * A. N. Kievsky
       I have more trouble with that awful Jamal asshole than with
       exploding varmints from 2 decades ago.
     * Domo
       I never thought ISIS and morel mushrooms would be combined into a
       joke.
       Thanks, RLM!
     * Palpatine
       Every joke in this episode hit bullseye. Just like a hunter
       shooting a varmint.
     * Domo
       I honestly would love it if RLM took the Varmint audio footage of
       the 2 guys talking and mix that with morel mushroom farming visual
       footage, or something similar. It would be a dream come true!
     * Down Under Aussie (in Japan)
       Was Mike…sober?
     * Stant
       Hey Jack you got the bit about the weight of the bullet exactly
       backwards. Varmint ammo is lighter in weigh and as such travels
       faster. Also it is constructed in such a manner that when it
       impacts a animal it fragments causing the explosive effects. I
       can’t help but imagine what kinda of comments you four guys would
       make if you were out in a field shooting prairie dogs.
     * BitchFists
       good episode!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
     * Jerome Gorden
       Why do progressives cry like babies when they see animals die but
       don’t give a flying fuck about the millions of unborn children
       whose bodies have been mutilated and used for scientific
       experimentation?
     * Domo
       I now want to be incapable of doing air quotes, just like Jack

       So does Jessi work at RLM anymore?
     * Hank_Henshaw
       Exploding prairie dogs would’ve made Kingdom of the Crystal Skull
       more interesting.
     * The Wicker Man (BWF)
       There’s always one of you. At least you didn’t preface the sentence
       with “Actually”…
     * Alberto Hernandez Jr
       I’m pretty sure that’s origin for “The Last of Us.”

       I wonder what’s it about. Hopefully it’s not a redo of the

       The exploding varmint footage mixed with the music they use in ISIS
       propaganda videos would also make a potent combination.

       rightful place at my side!
       Everything is proceeding as I have foreseen…..

       oh god. that was disturbing. i can’t look up the varmint video

     * barsidious5 .
       I lost it when they had Exploding Varmints as the only video on the
       wheel. Just knew they weren’t going to let that one slip by.
     * The Wicker Man (BWF)
       For real, has she parted company with RLM? I find this troubling as
       these shows lack any diversity. We have no people of different of
       gender or people of color on these programs. Jay is the only
       non-cis white man on the program. It’s 2016 and this makes me
       uncomfortable and angers me.
     * Hank_Henshaw
       I felt cheated. It taught me there’s no artistic integrity left in
       this show.
     * Hank_Henshaw
       …like those poor woodland creatures in the video.

     * barsidious5 .
       Agreed. At least the psychos didn’t have close up footage of the
       animal corpses. Kept having flashbacks of Tree Stand Safety:
       “It’s like a puppet now…..I’m going to make it talk!”
       – Rich Evans
     * Hank_Henshaw
       Plus, they were all CGI. No harm, no foul.

       That’s the goddamned joke!

       Lack of integrity? yes. High levels of hack fraudery? yes. Lack of

     * Reilly Thomas
       He’s absolutely correct here. The fact that you aren’t interested
       or don’t care for what he’s talking about is irrelevant. I bet if
       he was posting about what kind of blaster Stormtroopers carried or
       the sexual orientation of an actor in an indie film, and he was
       incorrect, you’d lose your shit. Don’t act high and mighty about
       being wrong because you feel superior for being ignorant.

       From the morel mushroom hunting website:
       “Apparently he was mushroom hunting with friends near Louisiana,
       MO. He got separated from them and the ATV became tangled in some
       vines which caused it to flip on top of him, with no noticeable
       injuries. At that point, the ATV was not functional and Larry
       walked back to the lodge where he met his hunting partners. They
       then went to dinner. At dinner, Larry complained of being sore and
       remarked that he would probably be even sorer tomorrow. His friends
       insisted that he go to the hospital to be x-rayed for broken bones.
       While at the hospital he was joking with the nurse and then
       “seized” and died very quickly – cause unknown at this time.”

       This film, Queen of the Desert, has me wondering only a few minutes
       in, “Why was this film made?” Also, Nicole Kidman playing a young
       twenty-something, hmm. She acts the part well – perky, striving,

       I finished the WotW episode and they all agree how horrible and

       ‘shock-laughter.’ Laughter is social and contagious we all know if
       RLM has anything, it’s a sense of humor about, well, everything.
       Putting RLM aside, I’ll now comment on myself and no one else (I’m
       serious): It all just reminded me of the limitations of my
       adolescent friendships long ago. You don’t have the confidence in
       your own opinion (or you haven’t formed one yet) to (using this
       example) get up and eject the cassette and move onto another one
       because the content of the video is indecent. A combination of
       morbid curiosity and rigid commitment to an agreed-upon-beforehand
       objective or group harmony eclipses any other concerns. It would
       seem really uncool to protest and the worst part is that the only
       people who would agree and admire you for doing so would be lame
       adults – like present-day me right here wishing past me was uncool

       Fallon has basically turned celebrities into circus acts and for

       As a person living in a country where the most deadly weapon is a

       reference to gun laws and gun ownership.
       Being a game-fed cheerleader since the early age of 8, guns are
       only interesting if they come with a “fuckton of rockets” or at
       least one “rail” word in their name.

       then actually distributed it.

       These little fluffy wannabe squirrels are actually considered pest
       just because they burrow; as in they create holes. So, excuse my
       cynicism regarding the idea that the video was actually done as
       some kind of a pest control, as making them fucking explode creates
       holes in the ground and destroys the vegetation anyway, which was
       your fucking concern in the first place.

       I admit that I was a bit surprised at the censoring of the
       exploding prairie dogs. Like the guys said, the exploding varmint
       was so unexpected that it seemed unreal. I almost thought it was
       all going to be fake, some using bombs to blow up fake prairie
       dogs.
       That party video was for eight year olds. It was kinds neat to Fred
       Newman there. He does all kinds of sound effects for A Prairie Home

       well. I love gore and find it funny, but that’s with knowing none

       Since nobody asked for it, here’s my mini review of Tim Miller’s
       directorial indie debut, Deadpool;
       It was pretty good. Far better than I was anticipating to be sure,
       especially after how unenthused I was by any of the trailers.
       I was really dreading that the character was gonna be written like
       the Daniel Way version, with the multiple voices in his head,
       breaking the fourth wall constantly to the point of annoyance, all
       that shit that killed my interest in the comic years ago.
       Weirdly enough, the worst aspect of the movie for me was the
       profanity and lewdness. I wasn’t bothered by the fact that there
       was any in the movie, but that the execution of it was handled so
       sloppily and done so frequently that it began to lose any impact.
       There were also several instances where the writers thought just
       having cursing was a substitute for having a joke, and it never
       works unless you’re still 13-years-old. Every insult or exchange
       that involved a word like “fuckwaffle” or “asshat” made me groan
       just a little. Ironically, the coveted R-rating they were aiming
       for hurt the movie to a degree, and became an excuse to be lazy
       rather than do something a little more clever like they had to do
       in the more restricted comics.
       That said, the actual jokes that worked, REALLY worked. The pizza
       delivery scene, the holiday-themed sex scenes, everything in Blind
       Al’s apartment. Those all hit the mark and felt like classic
       Deadpool moments.
       All the dramatic and serious moments also felt really tense and
       engaging, and the love story was leagues better than most other
       superhero films. Even the villain was more memorable, menacing, and
       genuinely loathsome than most of the bad guys that have shown up in
       the recent Marvel movies, despite being based on a D-list villain.
       And even though Colossus and Negasonic were ultimately superfluous
       and not at all relevant to the plot, they were consistently the
       most enjoyable parts of the movie for me. ESPECIALLY Colossus, I
       don’t think I’ve seen a movie version of a superhero that felt so
       exactly like the comics version in every single way; from the look,
       to the personality, to the mannerisms, to even the voice you’d
       imagine he would have. 10/10, best boy.
       So yeah, movie was satisfying and way more enjoyable than I
       anticipated, though it could have handled several aspects of itself
       much better. Imma give it a solid thumbs up outta 5.

       character Doug, that was some asshole named Billy West who never
       did anything popular again.) No Fred Newman was the “voice” you
       always heard on Doug, doing, well, all the noises, singing, and
       scatting you heard in the background.

     * Red Skeleton
       Yeah I remember the day they aired Doug, Rugrats and Ren and

       thought Doug was going to be the big hit. I seem to recall it got a
       lot more promotion in the run up than the other two. How Ironic
       that a) Rugrats ended up being the long-runner, b) Ren and Stimpy
       ended up making the biggest cultural impact, and c) Nick sold the
       shit out of Doug off to Disney.
       Yeah, I liked old Doug. I didn’t love it but I liked it. Disney
       ripped out its soul. And they stopped using Fred Newman’s sound
       effects and started using real music IIRC.

       ill? *shudder*). They cut that out and made it into a, I dunno,
       more sanitized cartoon after the first season or so. In retrospect,

       I really don’t get it. Have you guys never heard of hunting? You
       know, that outdoor activity enjoyed by tens of millions of people?
       Before watching this video, what exactly did you think hunting
       consisted of?
       I understand it’s not for everyone. I even understand some people
       find hunting immoral or distasteful. But I’m quite shocked at your
       collective ignorance and surprise at the fact that people find and
       kill animals for sport and have done so since long before the dawn
       of history.
       I won’t even get into Jack’s “grain count” discussion, but rest
       assured it was super lulzy.

       But the video went viralllll. He does so many sweet, awesome viral

     * Red Skeleton
       Yeah, I don’t think it’s the fact he was killing the animals for
       sport that bothered them. I think it was just the extent of the
       pleasure he was taking in it went from sporting to psychopathy…

       It’s not about hunting, it’s about the glorification of the death
       and physical destruction of animals.
       Make a video about hunting, what guns and ammo to use and where to
       find the animals and only PETA members would complain. This video
       was just about cruel bug squashing teenagers that never grew up.

       Yes. But the video was called Exploding [Fucking] Varmints. Based
       merely on that I could have guessed it was mainly footage of
       shooting varmints with probably too large of a round. I’m not
       saying that’s my idea of sunday afternoon entertainment, but I
       don’t understand their surprise.
       I get that the video from “Home Action Video” edited it focus on
       the Exploding [Fucking] Varmints, but that pretty much varmint
       hunting. You go sit in a field, you wait for the critter to pop out
       and you shoot it. Sometimes they explode. Ever been to a shooting
       gallery? What do you think that’s trying to simulate?
       I can sum up what I’m trying to say with “What did they think
       ‘Exploding Varmints’ was going to be?”

       Was there really surprise, as in they didn’t expect to see this? I
       think they knew very well what they were going to see. Their
       “surprise” was more a disguised form of disgust I guess. Aimed not
       specifically at hunting, but just the lack of class in that
       specific video.
       Think about it this way, it’s actually creepier to think the
       content of this video is highly entertaining, than it is to do what
       is actually done in this video. I just think they were surprised
       that there are people who enjoy watching a video of just this,
       without anything else.
     * RLMkeepitup
       it does bring up interesting points. As Mike said hunting has its
       place, and Rich said the video is what he expected..they’re not
       ignorant. I’m not sure what Jack was talking about..
     * Wizard Phoenix
       Deadpool was sold out at the near by multiplex. So I saw Zoolander
       2 instead….please kill me. Wow this movie sucked so much. I almost
       hated this movie, just almost hated it. Believe it or not there are
       positives:
       1. The characters from the original have not been ruined or
       destroyed.
       2. The original still exists
       3. Penelope Cruz gave me a boner
       4. Kiefer Sutherland’s horrible cameo made for a lot of Metal Gear
       jokes
       That’s it. Let’s talk about the biggest problem: its the opposite
       of the first Zoolander. You see Zoolander was a smart satire on the
       media, control of media, and the idiots that they tell us that we
       should look up to. It of course had celebrity cameos as well but
       certain ones were used appropriately. The David Bowie cameo had to
       be in a weird funny scene because he was David fucking Bowie and
       the red carpet interviews in the beginning where just celebrities
       talking about them once or maybe twice and they’re not important or
       funny but they establish the world. So for Zoolander 2’s pre
       production Ben Stiller must have said, “Hey, I made Tropic Thunder
       and Zoolander, two smart comedies about the current state of media.
       For Zoolander 2 how about I don’t be smart and instead reuse gags
       and make horrible unfunny cameos.” There were no jokes in the film.
       There were references to the original film and things in pop
       culture today but nothing funny is done with it and there’s no
       satire. Okay so if that doesn’t work made the cameos are funny:
       THEY ARE NOT. Benedict Cumberbatch plays some model named All. All
       is transgender and that’s it. There’s no joke All is just
       transgender. Kiefer Sutherland gets pregnant with Hansel’s baby and
       then has a miscarriage. There is no joke because there was no set
       up at all for it and the pay off is delivered so horribly. The
       Metal Gear jokes I made up in my head where funnier than this.
       Hell, my friend’s horrible screenplay for Dead Artists, a movie
       about dead musicians fighting demons, was funnier. I think the
       saddest part is that while the film is fucking terrible everyone in
       the film wanted to make it. So to see these very talented people
       try and fail miserably just made it worse especially since I have
       seen them do far better like the first Zoolander. Also movie, no
       woman over 17 thinks Justin Bieber is good looking. To quote my
       girlfriend, “Women like me want to fuck Tom Hardy. No one likes
       him, he stole the title of an awesome Queen song.”

       Exploding Varmints, while Rich just acted like the evil stoner guy
       who wears his baseball hat too low and skulks about everything.
       Rich is evil. I still love him though, how can you not after

       think about that for a second.

       I disagree, he has seemed down for a bit particularly in HitB, I
       wanted him to get happier, but if he edited this video like I think
       he did the dozens of hours keyframing censoring of animals dying in
       slow motion might have taken a toll on his heart. I think next
       christmas he might need to get his heart to grow a few sizes again.

       You’re being knee-jerky. Watch the unedited video here:
       [216]https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H7Wy49bWSfA
       I come from rural culture, we hunt and eat animals. This is not
       hunting. This is an idiotic spectacle to appeal to this guy and
       others’ sociopathy. I might as well film myself plinking rats in my
       barn or something.
       The guys are not making some statement against hunting videos by
       denouncing it. It’s not a hunting video. It’s a video of a guy
       effortlessly plinking 500 prairie dogs with a high-powered rifle
       and scope, over and over and over again.
       I won’t really get into whether this is the most economical or
       humane way to kill these prairie dogs (the video does seem to
       intimate that some poisons are outlawed, so perhaps this is
       actually the only way farmers can get rid of an infestation), but
       why in the world would I try and defend someone filming it and
       selling it as a video?
     * Archfiend_Baramos
       The other guys thought that the guy in the video was using
       “explosive bullets”, Jack was just explaining that the bullet is so
       large and so powerful for the size of the creature that it is
       blowing the animal apart (no idea if he’s accurate in his
       explanation as to WHY, of course). Imagine a human getting hit by a
       cannonball, that’s basically what is happening to the prairie dog.
       It’s overkill. A .22 would be sufficient, it’s sufficient for a
       groundhog, anyway, can’t be too much difference.
       On the other hand perhaps it is more “humane” to instantly blow
       them to pieces…but it’s clearly also INSANE.
     * Archfiend_Baramos
       I just think they were surprised that the reality of the footage
       matched what they thought was the cartoony idea in their head of
       animals literally exploding.
     * Archfiend_Baramos
       If I had had to peg one of these guys for growing up on a farm or
       in a rural area, Jack would have been the least likely candidate.
       Surprising.
     * AKA Mr. Wint
       They were probably using hollow points; they explode on impact.
       Full metal jackets pass through tissue cleanly. Jack was kind of
       right.
     * Archfiend_Baramos
       Yes, I was just about to edit my post. I skipped through the video
       and he does say “ballistic” tips. So I’m guessing these explode
       into shrapnel on impact and tear through the animal.
       Again, though, it seems insane. I doubt bullets like that are
       particularly cheap, he said .223 Winchester ballistic tip bullets.
       To kill 500 prairie dogs I think he must have spent a lot of money,
       even in 1980s dollars. It just seems crazy. I think to kill 500
       prairie dogs would cost a couple hundred dollars nowadays.
     * AKA Mr. Wint
       .223 is the most common round available. Great for dear hunting.
       Not too expensive; .22 is much more expensive. Hollow point, yes,
       explodes on impact.
     * AKA Mr. Wint
       Not true.
     * Archfiend_Baramos
       Yeah, but looking up this particular bullet with the ballistic tip,
       it costs 25 dollars now for 20 rounds. Now, I’m assuming in 1980s
       dollars it was way cheaper (although accounting for inflation,
       maybe not), and maybe he bought it in bulk and saved even more
       money, but it still seems like he spent way too much money for this
       to be the economical way to get rid of prairie dogs.
       .22 when I bought it last was very cheap, although it was probably
       the cheapest, crappiest brand they had.
       EDIT: 50 rounds is 3 dollars for .22 rounds, Winchester brand. Low
       grain count, though.
     * AKA Mr. Wint
       It’s not. You could trap them.

       I think it was a pretty good ode to the Kelly run, hopefully
       they’ll continue doing stories from it for the sequel (which I have
       read has been greenlit). I would enjoy seeing T-Ray as the villain
       in the next one (I don’t think we’ll be seeing armored Ajax or
       anything of that nature). Definitely a better movie than I expected
       them to achieve, I didn’t think it would be bad like some people
       did but I did temper my expectations.
       Obviously they cut out some minor characters like Killebrew and
       altered some (Weasel as the owner of the bar instead of a super
       hacker seems to be limiting themselves on that front but clearly
       hacking wasn’t necessary for the plot they were telling) but I was
       very pleased with how close to the story they were. They could have
       altered and cut out WAY more.
       I agree the humor wasn’t perfect in every instance but what with
       insisting that 90% of the film be this non-stop running waterfall
       of snarky remarks I’m surprised the vast majority of them landed as
       well as they did. My biggest issue is I couldn’t understand
       everything Ajax was saying, and Deadpool’s constant torrent of
       jokes was so extreme that a lot of them were drowned out by the
       audience laughing at an earlier one. Timing was off in the
       delivery.

       Metastatistics are bad when applied to pure numbers. I think
       they’re an even worse measure of the worth of a piece of art, which
       is about as subjective as you can get. Some of my favorite movies
       have bad scores on Rotten Tomatoes, because the critics didn’t get
       what the point of the movie was or ignored it when giving their
       critique. Case in point: Punisher War Zone.

       wasn’t quite as grotesque on a visceral level, I’m guessing.
       I don’t know how true that is, though. Granted, I too wasn’t too
       fazed by the varmints exploding (five or six was more than enough,
       though), but having seen videos of real people getting shot or what
       have you I viscerally find it atrocious and don’t want to see such
       things, despite having played many a violent FPS and seen many a

       Neither is entirely accurate. Apes have been shown to use group
       tactics to hunt monkeys and eat them. On the other hand they are
       also fine with harvesting whatever they can find as you say.
       Really humans are so divorced from their instincts that it’s
       pointless to say we are predators or scavengers. We’re thousands of
       years post-domestication and agriculture. Yes, we can still get an
       adrenaline rush from the activity of hunting, and a cheap (and
       grotesque and pointless) thrill from effortlessly blowing away a
       bunch of stupid varmints or watching it, but I don’t think it has
       any bearing on the human species as a whole at this juncture.

       only dismayed by the implication this dude was crazy for the mere
       fact he was enjoying shooting prairie dogs. In fact he is crazy for
       editing together 500 clips of zoomed in footage of exploding
       rodents and selling it as an “action movie.”
     * Archfiend_Baramos
       The problem with PETA is they can’t make distinctions between
       something like this and raising and slaughtering cattle for meat,
       or hunting a deer for meat. Of course, some people at the other
       extreme end of the spectrum maybe can’t make a distinction, either,
       and would defend such a pointlessly grotesque video the same way
       they might a normal “hunting” video (this clearly isn’t hunting,
       it’s pest eradication called hunting by a guy interested in selling
       a video to give people the cheap thrill of seeing 500 prairie dogs
       exploded).
       So many debates I see on the news and on the internet seem to
       revolve around purposefully not making distinctions regarding
       context, motivations, or magnitude, though, so I’m not surprised
       PETA exists.

       I was surprised at first that they “wimped” out, but upon watching

       Not to be “that guy”, but I actually think Rich went a little far
       calling the guy autistic. I know some people got offended at him
       calling people retarded and maybe this was his response to that,
       trying to be “non-PC”, but at least that’s a common “turn of
       phrase” for people who want to call others very stupid (imprecise
       to interchange with “stupid”, and definitely offensive to a lot of
       people, but at least a COMMON use of the word).
       This guy had nothing in common with autistic people beyond an
       obsession with a specific topic. No flat affect, no repetitive
       language, his obsession was not in the common form of
       “perseverating” autistic people have, nothing. He is perhaps
       DELUSIONAL, that’s for sure, and his humor was weird and not funny.
       But he wasn’t autistic at all. To me that was just Rich trying to
       be provocative for no good reason.

       Despite the guy saying that poison is outlawed in certain places,
       that does appear to be the most effective, economical way to kill
       them and enough pages mention it that I’m guessing that someone
       thought better of it and allowed certain pest extermination people
       to go in and poison them or the laws have changed since whenever
       this was shot (or he was just talking out of his ass). I know they
       used to also gas things like rabbit warrens, I’m guessing that is
       or at least was a common method for prairie dogs.
       Basically, I think he used the most grotesque, least economical
       method to kill them because he got a kick out of it.

       can just poison them. I’m not going to pretend shooting them one by
       one is the most economical way of exterminating them.
       Heck, even as entertainment, by the end of the video they were
       clearly sick of seeing the same thing over and over again. The

       I think they’re stuck between the opposing facts that they have to
       have it be a randomized wheel (or the Wheel of the Worst concept
       goes out the window) and the fact that there are videos they just
       want to watch so badly or are so anticipated by the audience (Shoji
       Tabuchi clearly was one) that they break the concept to watch them.
       I think 1 out of 3 should probably be their limit. They can cheat

       looked up Exploding Varmints on YouTube, watched about 4 minutes,
       and like any normal human was completely horrified by it.
       I feel like the guy from Exploding Varmints should come with a

       big fat voracious brown barn rats with bad attitudes and mouths

       I come from a family of farmers and hunters and I really don’t
       understand how you are comparing hunting for sport to these sickos.
       I mean the purpose of hunting for sport isn’t about getting
       pleasure from killing animals, it’s about the challenge and the
       satisfaction of getting that one big kill cause you worked your ass
       off to travel into the forest and track it down.
       The feeling is a feeling of reward for the effort you put in, not
       pleasure over killing something. That’s why the guy that made this
       video is just a sicko cause these animals are just defenseless,
       there’s no challenge, no risk of putting in effort and getting
       nothing in return, he myswell be shooting targets.
       And as for the farming side of the argument, yes shooting vermin is
       acceptable on a farm. It is actually better than some of the traps
       we use where I live…
       Here’s one example: You can probably guess what it does…
       [250]http://www.amazon.com/Victor-Plunger-Style-Mole-Trap/dp/B00004
       RAMS
       It’s also probably better than poison because poison will kill
       vermin effectively but with also kill any predatory animals that
       eat the vermin that ingest poison. We have lost two cats this way
       and it can kill hawks and owls.
       So shooting them if you see them isn’t a bad idea. BUT you don’t
       shoot them out of this psycho need to make them suffer, you shoot
       them cause it’s your job. It’s like: “Awww shit I gotta take care
       of these stupid vermin damn it!” instead of, “Oh baby I’m so
       excited to blow up small creatures!”.

       suffering (10 seconds or 10 minutes your call?)
       I cried.
       But we blew up a rabbit warren with LPG and I laughed! not because
       killing things was funny but the enormity of the explosion caused a
       adrenaline reaction that makes you laugh or shit your pants.

       There are a lot of autistics that you may not notice are autistic
       ASIDE from an obsession with a specific topic, especially in a
       video where you may not see things like repetitive motion tics. I
       know people on the spectrum who are always grinning, or who are
       prone to VERY powerful anger and very powerful emotions in general,
       so the flat affect isn’t guaranteed either. If he was on the
       spectrum it’d be mild, but the reason why Rich said that wasn’t
       just the obsession with the topic but the sort of weird humor and
       the lack of any kind of social awareness the video showed. The
       average person obsessed with a weird topic might be able to
       communicate it in an interesting way. An autistic person might
       generate a ton of mushroom porn.
       But yes, “autistic” is often imprecisely used, ditto for
       “retarded”. And I also do hate the idea, “Other people will say
       things you don’t like”. Sure, and then you get yelled at in
       response. If the person who says a thing that offends people gets
       to do that, other people get to say their mind back. I’m always
       annoyed by that attitude because it is such a double standard.

       Guns + explosions = fun.
       Killing animals = hunting = fun.
       While cooking? Well then stir that chickensoup and stir it
       reeaaaaal good, till you see the little bits of chickens that were
       most likely devastated and hurt beyond recognition, while hoping
       that they were at least half-dead before being chopped up by a
       machine, so you don’t have to eat a salad on a Sunday afternoon.
       Let’s face it, the nature was a simple race to the first specie
       that will make it to the finishing line in form of an AK-47. After

       It’s hypocrisy and double standards at best.
       “Trying to profit from others enjoying it.” Well, except food,
       clothes, animal fights, circus, basically every animal we
       domesticated… Yea, I can’t see that happening in a modern society.
       Look, I am just making fun of it, not out of you, because fuck, I
       never got this. People always care only when it is brought to their
       attention on a silver platter (hamburger joke intended). I would
       also like to remind you the brutal truth: You know why they make a

       We’re not a predator species.
       Can you chase down a gazelle and kill it without tools? How about a

       Our early ancestors were opportunistic omnivores. They would eat
       the bone marrow of animals that the lions left behind.
       Is there any monkey species that is a predator, besides us? Why do
       you assume we’re unique?
       Take a cat for example. From a housecat to a lion, all cats are
       predators.
       Take the equines. Zebra to horse are all herbivores.
       Name any species in which a close relative is something like an
       herbivore, and another close relative is a predator, besides
       “humans”- which is your one exception, because it’s not an

       We dont have claws or monster fangs so we adapted into using mostly
       tools.
       Thats doesnt NOT make you a predator.
       Bears, lizards, turtles, several types of birds and fish, chimps
       and apes are also omnivores while gorillas are mostly herbivore
       and lets see, sharks.

       So I just came back from Deadpool. Thank God because Zoolander 2
       was so unfunny. This movie had me laughing so hard at the set up
       for joke and laughing even harder at the pay off to the point when
       I was in physical fucking pain. In short it was short, sweet,
       action packed, and had a hard R Rating. For what it was perfect.
       Not a perfect movie but a perfect Deadpool movie. The jokes are so
       tight and perfect in this movie. Jokes that poke fun of action
       movies, stupid reused songs, and People magazine’s sexiest man
       alive. Every set up for a joke has a payoff and the payoff is
       perfect every single time. This movie is a testament to good
       re-writing. If a joke doesn’t work you should keep rewriting it
       until it work. It even has good masturbation jokes. I haven’t seen
       a good masturbation joke since Mister Plinkett’s Indiana Jones
       review. The action is spectacular. Finally comic movies are
       embracing their roots by sticking to what works with the character
       is a wacky, intense manner. They have a great blend of CG and
       practical effects and they make it silly, they make it comic
       book-ie in a good way. Unlike Fant4stic….speaking of CG there is
       Colossus. If you read the comics and watch the movies you know that
       the movie Colossus is not really Colossus. This movie has him
       nailed down. He’s a giant guy with an even bigger heart making for
       great comedic relief. Speaking of comedic relief the cast are all
       great. Finally the romance. It is a romance between two horrible
       people and who get to know one another basically by fucking most of
       the time. Surprisingly the love story and emotional moments work.
       There’s a great tone here which I hope more comic book movies find.
       9.2/10. I wasn’t expecting this good but it was that good. It’s not

       Irrelevant. A joke is either funny or it is not funny. The amount

       increase or decrease the quality of the joke.

     We very well can use our bare hands to catch animals.
       Ever done it? Ever caught an animal, with your bare hands, and ate
       it, without cooking the meat?

     we’re a predator species, we hunt and fish and consume animals we
     kill.
       Yes, we do. This is due to our intelligence. Not due to our
       physiology. Deer will eat meat, when they have an opportunity to do
       it.

     Thats doesnt NOT make you a predator.
       Yes, it does. The fact that we need to use tools and we have to
       cook flesh to make it safe to eat tells you explicitly what our
       ancestors were like. We cook meat because our stomach cannot
       eliminate the bacteria and parasites found in meat.
       A dog, it has no problem with them. They are carnivores, we’re not
       even close. We are opportunistic carnivores at best, not predators.

       “Ever done it? Ever caught an animal, with your bare hands, and ate
       it, without cooking the meat?”
       not me personally but many species of animals you can
       “Yes, we do. This is due to our intelligence. Not due to our
       physiology. ”
       Physiology includes the organs, like brains as well as tool making
       you fucking moron. Our thumbs and brains are evolved to use tools
       to our advantage, and when we eat meat it helps our brain growth
       being a predator DOES NOT LIMIT YOU TO USING CLAWS AND TEETH.
       By definition and EVERY CREDIBLE SCIENTIST EVERYWHERE we are
       predators, we are even evolved to sweat in order to run down prey.
       we have binocular vision where our eyes face the same
       direction….LIKE A PREDATOR. Why? Because most primates are
       omnivorous meaning they’re predators to some degree….except
       gorillas.
       “The fact that we need to use tools and we have to cook flesh to
       make it safe to eat tells you explicitly what our ancestors were
       like. We cook meat because our stomach cannot eliminate the
       bacteria and parasites found in meat.”
       WRONG ASSHOLE!!!
       you can infact eat raw meat, but cooking meat is more advantageous
       because it eliminates parasites and helps to reduce sicknesses and
       is easier on digestion. Thats less stress on our bodies and more
       energy preserved and more carbs and vitamins to our brains.
       We actually could take all that shit you said, but we all wanted to
       live longer than 25.
       “A dog, it has no problem with them. They are carnivores, we’re not
       even close. ”
       a dog also lives 15 years max and is a domesticated wolf, they also
       dont have thumbs and lack object permanence.

       Wolverine in the movies is kind of a softie. I have to admit I’ve
       only seen the first 2 X-Men movies and the one that was in the 60s
       (in which Wolverine only had a cameo). Magneto, Ian McKellen is
       great an all, but I never imagined Magneto was a frail old man.
       Professor X, is pretty spot on, I guess.
       Bryan Singer’s vision for superhero movies does nothing for me. Not
       saying they are bad, as they’ve got critical acclaim, but I don’t
       enjoy them. Don’t get me started on what he did with Superman.
     * richardwicks

     not me personally but many species of animals you can
       That’s my point.
       You are descended from a scavenger, not a carnivore. This is why
       you cannot kill an animal without weapons. Your early ancestors ate
       the stuff that real predators left behind.

     “Our thumbs and brains are evolved to use tools to our advantage,
     and when we eat meat it helps our brain growth”
       ANY animal will eat meat given the opportunity.

     “By definition and EVERY CREDIBLE SCIENTIST EVERYWHERE we are
     predators”

       there was some regulation against marketing physical stuntwork at
       5-year-olds so they had to change it. Or maybe they signed Jaleel
       White on after filming the other stuff and decided his name was

       “Exploding Varmints” video actually took enjoyment out of it.
       That’s sick. I grew up in the country. I’ve hunted, fished, and
       trapped invasive species, and even managed land and have done it
       all my life, but you don’t take enjoyment from having to kill an
       animal. You do it out of necessity. Whether you hunt prairie dogs
       or bigger game like deer, hogs, etc. your obligation as a hunter is
       to provide the animal a clean kill so they don’t suffer. When you
       harvest an animal, you make sure it doesn’t go to waste. Doing the
       kind of stuff in that video for fun is disgraceful to
       conservationists and hunters like me.

       of artist’s soul and process.

       It’s bad enough that they’re remaking a classic film, but the fact
       that it has an all-female cast seems to be more of a ploy just to
       stir up controversy in a project that otherwise would have minimal
       attention, rather than any drive for diversity.
       Add in that really cynical visit to the children’s hospital and the
       producers’ attempts to deflect all criticism as sexist (protip;
       kids in hospitals like being visited by actors/characters they’re
       familiar with. Ain’t no 7-year-old cancer patient gonna be excited
       about the actors from an upcoming remake of a film decades before
       their time), and this whole project feels particularly
       manipulative.
       Aside from the genuine racists/sexists, I think most people
       wouldn’t be opposed to this project if it was an original project
       and not yet another cash-grab that reduces diversity and equality

       Yea, Czech comedies are kinda… dark. But The Loners are hilarious,
       although a lot of it might fall flat due to translation / cultural
       understanding.
       Actually both of the comedies I mentioned are mostly about laughing
       at tragedy. While Pelíšky are kinda obvious, since they are set in
       one of the most painful moments of our history, The Loners appear
       as a cool comedy about drugs, love and rock’n’roll, filled with

       To put it into perspective, here is a scene from The Loners.
       One of the character’s mother (who was a hoarder) dies, so he
       throws a little gathering in her flat. He invites a stalker, who is
       bound to win over a heart of a girl who is attending this
       gathering. He invites him just to see what happens. So how does she
       get rid of the stalker? Well, they bake marijuana into cookies to
       calm him down, so the after-funeral gathering turns into a rave
       party. And then the stalker tries to set her on fire.
       You see? Hilarious.

       OK… besides what you said about kids and characters (the whole
       thing reminds me of the scenes from the Ghostbusters 2 opening and
       kids demanding He-Man) even as a promo it’s… backwards.
       You make the movie – THEN you go around in costume and promote it.
       That way, if the movie is good – you’re awesome.
       If it is bad – well at least you’re heart is in it and maybe it’s
       just bad luck this time.
       What they are doing is presupposing that the movie will be SO
       awesome – everyone will be overjoyed to join in with their
       promotion even without seeing the movie.
       I.e. They are being arrogant assholes.
       Who are willing to use sick kids to promote a movie.
       This is so many ways of wrong… What if there’s a terminally ill kid

       he made clear that he sees the Star Wars movies as “kids movies”. I
       always thought that is a cheap excuse for the prequels for beeing
       bad like Plinkett has said it himself. But now after watching an
       interview… maybe if you don’t have the mindset of working on
       something great, lack the respect for the universe, a movie is
       doomed to become a “prequel”. Or in other words where is the “love”
       between George and Star Wars? Long gone.
     * Bubs
       George Lucas’s very first draft of Star Wars: Episode IV – A New
       Hope (1977) began, “This is the story of Mace Windu, a revered
       Jedi-bendu of Opuchi who was related to Usby C.J. Thape, a padawan
       learner of the famed Jedi.”
       And then someone with talent and screenwriting ability came along
       and fixed it. Thus, the formula for Star Wars becomes:
       100 * t * $
       ————
       c
       where c = Crazy Person
       t = Talented People
       And $ = money
       As you can see, you must always divide by One Crazy Person.

     * Like Icare
       You mean a phenomenon of individuals with an ability to move
       objects through time and space suddenly appearing just decades
       prior to time-travel becoming operational – in the exact location
       in time where the exit node for the time-travel just happens to be?
       Resulting eventually in the existence of a “Rainmaker” – an
       immensely powerful creature whose sole motivation in life is
       destruction of people who are tearing holes through time, for the
       purpose of financing themselves from the past by beaming themselves
       precious metals.
       I.e. They are fucking with the laws of physics, thus creating
       conditions where the same object can exist in two times and places
       at once, as that timeline is in a loop.
       Thus, when young Joe learns something old Joe knows it too, despite
       young Joe’s life (i.e. timeline) clearly being different.
       Two of them effectively have a telepathic link because information
       keeps being streamed down the timeline and then making a jump back
       up the timeline with old Joe.
       The loop never stops just as the passage of time never stops.
       Same thing goes for young Seth (Paul Dano) and old Seth.
       Only it’s not just thoughts, but as one is tortured, the other
       one’s body gets affected instantly.
       Cause they are one object in two places in time and space at the
       same time.
       Paradox works.
       So… because time and space are fucked, we have both instant
       transfer of information (what young Joe learns old Joe knows) and
       instant affecting of matter (when young Seth is cut old Seth gets
       scars).
       Both are cases of changing the present by changing the future by
       changing ITS past and both are the artifacts of time-travel ripping
       the holes in time-space.
       And as that means fucking with fundamental laws – similar “send
       information with your mind” and “affect object’s future position
       and shape” artifacts start popping around everywhere.
       Until it all reaches a critical mass, breaking the loop, or
       collapsing the loop, or closing the loop, or destroying the
       universe…

       That video is a good summation of SNL. Topical, stale, and ironic
       given the flac the show received a few years ago for featuring
       vastly mostly white cast. That said the conservative culture war
       known as the Beyoncepocalypse is sort of the symptom of the current
       political atmosphere. Where many politicians traded in dog whistle
       talk to mobilize anti-immigration conservatives around their
       candidacy, Trump broke the dog whistle and turned it into a
       bullhorn creating a situation for white folks who feel like their
       country is getting away from them to publicly pronounce their
       bigotry as a bold political statement with a positive feedback loop
       to keep the shit chugging.
       It isn’t pretty and is a recipe for disaster if the establishment
       can’t circle the wagons to prevent a Trump victory in the primary.
       I’m not worried about him winning the general election. It is not
       possible. He most certainly would be trounced. Some might even say
       Trumped. The real problem would be the fact that a Trump nomination
       would turn the Republican Party into a White nativist special
       interest party for years to follow. And would have a hard time
       shedding that image and brand for awhile.

       Without sounding too much like “9/11 was an inside job”, the
       Republican party restructured the rules of the primary to make it
       impossible for Trump to get the nomination. He has to win 60% of
       the delegates to get the automatic nomination. And since there are
       800 Republican candidates, it’s not going to happen. The Democrats
       pulled a similar trick with Bernie Sanders.
       So my bet is it’ll be Clinton Vs. Bush. Wouldn’t want to upset the
       status quo (read: Wall St. Bankers), now would we?

       “In 2007, Dr. Eric Bui, a psychiatrist in Toulouse, France,
       co-wrote a study that diagnosed Anakin Skywalker as having
       borderline personality disorder. When the authors reported their
       findings at the annual meeting of the American Psychiatric
       Association they stated that Skywalker fit the diagnosis criteria:
       difficulty controlling anger, stress-related breaks with reality,
       impulsivity, obsession with abandonment and a “pattern of unstable
       and intense interpersonal relationships characterized by
       alternating between extremes of ideation and devaluation”.”

       Watched Space Cop with commentary… apparently Mike and the gang
       filmed a Plinkett review for “Doc of the Dead,” a documentary about
       zombie movies, that was mostly cut from the final film.
       Unfortunately they sold the rights to the footage so they can’t
       release it. That means there’s a mythical “lost” Plinkett review!

       Yeah, this is Leftist non-sense that is going on here as well.

       If all contests in the primary were proportional you’d be
       absolutely right. Almost half of them though are winner-take all or
       have a winner take all threshhold variant (mostly fifty plus =
       all). Meaning Trump has an actual chance of flirting with that
       number by the time we reach a brokered convention in that scenario.
       And if it comes down to Trump then Cruz with sixty plus delegates
       in their pockets the establishment will be hard pressed to turn
       around and nominate the establishment candidate that finished
       third. In fact it would be unacceptable and would likely result in
       a Trump third party run. Their is a serious argument in that case
       to let Trump rent the party to give the noisy barking moonbat wing
       the catharsis it pines for and try to rebuild from the ashes. Trump
       would likely go back to his tower to sulk and pay someone to write
       a book about his adventures. And afterwards the establishment will
       enjoy a lot of I told you so’s.
       The preferred method is to winnow down the establishment choices to
       one to carry forty percent pluralities before many of the winner
       take all’s hit (not happening before SC though). Put Trump on a
       losing streak, taking away the manly allure that is attracting his
       first time primary voters to the polls. Thus bursting the bubble.
     * AKA Mr. Wint
       Yeah, it is. It’s startling that people think that doing what is
       right equates to just being a big pussy and letting certain groups
       get away with said non-sense. And we, as the majority, cannot have
       a say in any of it outside of compliance.
     * AKA Mr. Wint
       Well, yes, he’s using a tactic to rally supporters. Big-Bern is
       doing the same thing with this, ‘tax the Rich, free college, $15
       minimum wage’ crap too. He’s saying outrageous things too, to get
       supporters, he’s just going the acceptable, Large-Claim route that
       is safe. At least Trump is showing he has balls. Bernie Sanders is
       doing the same thing Obama did in ’08; I’m super cool, and you can
       be too, if you vote for me!’. I disagree with the potential effect
       of Trump you intimate; what he is saying is being blown out of
       proportion. Bringing back jobs to the U.S. is what we need and
       Donald is touting that.
     * AKA Mr. Wint
       I think you may be right.

       Also, Chewbacca would’ve been his adoptive father in the prequels,
       but by the time of Star Wars ’77, he is treating Chewie as a 2nd in
       command/bodyguard?
       You Star Wars fans really dodged a bullet there, and must thank
       whomever it was that told Lucas that having Han Solo in the

       And the plan for all these jobs to come back is to trust that Trump
       can negotiate trade deals of the likes that no one has ever before
       in the history of trade deals. Trust him they will be great. The
       developing world will gladly give back all these factory jobs and
       return to the humble subsistence farming they once enjoyed once
       they see how awesome the Donald is. That is not to point out that
       the Bern is a better alternative. He’s trading on Santa Claus
       reforms.
       But if you think that his they’re bringing drugs, they’re rapists,
       and some of them are I suppose are good people, his reactionary we
       need to ban all Muslims until we figure this out, his intimations
       that it might be necessary to shut down mosques, his repeated
       desire to deport millions, his candidate surrogates pointing to
       Roosevelt’s Japanese internment as valid reasoning for banning said
       Muslim’s, his early foreign policy statements about using the US
       military to kick in the teeth of the Middle East and use its oil to
       fund said teeth kicking and then some (only when manbro VI Putin
       has gotten involved in Syria has the Donald found his dove streak),
       his, “at least Putin is a leader,” response to Putin’s murder of
       journalists critical of him, his love affair with the word bimbo,
       Megyn Kelly’s menstrual cycle, look at that face who could vote for
       that face, and easily thousands of tweets and uncomfortable moments
       on The Apprentice somehow doesn’t make the Donald look overtly
       bigoted, petty, reactionary, irresponsible, childish, and generally
       a cathartic power fantasy masquerading as a political movement I
       have no words.
       I know the man is trading on running against the media while at the
       same time being a trainwreck to have them at his beck and call, but
       there comes a point where you have to call a duck a duck. And this

       “Sanders doing the same thing” as Trump would be him presenting the
       “program” of Lance Corporal Jeffrey Carazales from Cuero, Texas –
       as shown in “Generation Kill”:
       “Carazales is from Cuero, Texas, hates the Marine Corps, hates
       officers, hates rich people. “They should make a holiday every year
       where if you make less than thirty thousand dollars a year you get
       to drive into rich neighborhoods and fuck up rich people’s houses.
       Go inside and break their shit. Every blue-collar man gets to sleep
       in a white-collar man’s house.”
       Sometimes he asks fellow Marines, “Have you ever read the Communist
       Manifesto? That sounds ideal. How the upper classes are oppressing
       the lower classes. That’s how it happens back home. Rich people,
       corporations, get all sorts of secret government handouts they
       don’t tell us about.”
       And boy would Americans go crazy about THAT idea!
       As shown 100 or so pages later:
       Marines rifle through everything, looking for souvenirs, but all
       they find are colored pens and coffee mugs. “It’s all stupid crap,”
       one of them says, slamming his wrench into a computer screen.
       The Marines kick down the door to what looks like the boss’s office
       in the corner. One of them sits behind the expansive wooden desk,
       punches buttons on the speakerphone and plays boss. “Have my
       secretary send in my next appointment,” he says in an obnoxiously
       official voice.
       Then he starts smashing the phone and the desk apart with his
       wrench.
       The Marines destroy the boss’s office with gleeful vengeance,
       throwing stuff at the walls, pissing in the corner, all of them
       maniacally laughing. In a weird way, they’re living out the fantasy
       Carazales often talks about— in which one day a year the
       blue-collar man gets to go into rich neighborhoods
       and smash apart expensive homes.
       That would be the equivalent of Trumps “promises” of walls that
       will be paid by Mexico, eliminate department of education, EPA,
       Obamacare, rebuild everything for a third of the price, ban
       Muslims, kick out refugees, put Hillary in jail, legalize pot,
       cancel NASA, build a stronger military, act like a lunatic (i.e. be
       unpredictable), kill relatives of terrorists, drop traitors out of
       an airplane without a parachute… the list goes on.

       Linda Blair and a group of “revenge experts” discuss and
       demonstrate various ways to take revenge on people. From screwing
       around with their mail and signing them up for things they didn’t
       order to engaging in some light breaking & entering into their
       homes and performing acts of what some might call vandalism, others
       might call sabotage.

       No argument there. I understand that the repercussions of said

       mean, is that they are both using the same tactics (appealing to
       polar opposites) in order to garner support, I.e., potential
       voters. They’re both full of shit; Bernie more so if you ask me. He
       wants to turn us into a Germanic Utopia overnight; 50%+ taxation of
       the rich, free associates degrees, $15 minimum wage. He’s appealing
       to the slacker generation that I am sorrowfully a part of and it’s
       working. He’s using the same campaign ploy that Obama used; ‘Barak
       and Roll! Aren’t I Cool, Dogz?’. So pathetic. Trump may say a lot
       of crazy stuff; he still has to answer to the supreme court and a
       lot of what he is saying has been blown out of proportion.

       reference to Rosebud being his sled. But when I asked my dad about

       Let me put it this way – that’s a false equivalency.
       Sanders’ promises are based on a program. A plan.
       You can tell that by the fact that he uses numbers – i.e. he is
       quantifying EXACTLY what and how much he plans to do.
       E.g. Raising taxes on EVERYONE. More so on the rich, but everyone
       would pay more.
       [466]http://time.com/4194179/bernie-sanders-tax-plan/
       Trump’s promises are based on populist fear mongering for the
       masses and huge tax cuts for the rich – who are a minority.
       I.e. They are wooing the same economic group of voters.
       Only Sanders promises to tax them more and give them and their kids
       free stuff in return AND save them money in the process – while
       Trump promises them he’ll wage war on brown people and “bring back
       Christmas”.
       Also, the things Sanders promises are not the kind of promises a
       slacker might be interested in.
       Free healthcare is primarily interesting to low and middle income
       families with small kids.
       Free education likewise.
       Anyway…
       Here’s Trump’s “Issues” section of his campaign website:
       [467]https://www.donaldjtrump.com/issues/
       He presents what he sees as issues and solutions for said issues
       there.
       In 30-40 second videos of him staring at the camera and pretty much
       just saying words.
       Here’s Sanders’ “Issues” section:
       [468]https://berniesanders.com/issues/
       It’s a list of issues, with each issue and his plan for it
       explained in detail.
       There are pages and pages of text about each issue.
       Not a 30 second video.
       30 second videos are for slackers.

       That was weak by HBO standards. There was a whole scene after that
       when they were talking in the midst of all that fucking and I
       haven’t seen single pair of tits forcefully pressed on the screen.
       Check out the plans for extras for HBO’s Westworld – all the extras
       had to sign that they are ready for onscreen genitals-on-genitals
       touching shots. Now that’s the spirit!

       I was never really watching it. I just binged a season when I was
       bored and where there was nothing to do.
       The funny thing is that I sorta stopped giving a shit when it got
       mildly interesting.
       Speaking of: I heard the new season opener was the best episode
       yet. Boy oh boy, we are dangerously approaching the ratio of 1.1
       good episodes per season.

       People always spew bullshit. Some said S3 was an improvement over

       I think the highlight of the later seasons was a half-arsed attempt
       at actually doing something with characters, that worked out in
       exactly one episode.
       And then, later on, when they decided that their main characters
       should probably leave the emo mopey territory and finally start
       being badass sociopathic murderers.
       That worked for like two or three episodes.

       This. TWD is boring as hell! And I wonder if a soap opera about a

       scares and explicite scenes not so much from the “daily problems”
       between people. What I also miss are Zombie dogs, zombie aligators,
       super mutants. Monstrositys breaking through walls. Ripping people
       apart. Yeah I played resident evil (the good titles) but it is
       obvious to me that they didn’t want to spend much money on show.

       Remember that argument the next time you meet someone who couldn’t
       find a clue with both hands, flashlight, Google and a bloodhound
       while sitting on top of said clue – but who also lives there.
       Similarly, do remember that argument whenever you hear any analyst
       talk about anything that is not in the 100 meter circle around his
       or her house.
       How could they possible know anything about anything if they don’t
       live next to it, right?
       I mean… there’s no such thing as relaying information other than
       through sheer direct experience – which is why we teach all
       doctors, engineers, cooks and everyone else through constant trial
       and error until they get it right.
       Because the only way to learn anything is through direct
       experience.
       Similarly, trials are actually just for show. Judges actually just
       toss a coin.
       Cause how could they know what happened. They weren’t there.
       And the less is said about all those people claiming there are
       planets and stuff in space the better.
       I mean really… we’re supposed to believe that the Sun is this giant
       ball of superheated plasma only really far away – because some
       people who never even lived on the Sun claim so?
       Yeah, right…
       Like anyone could be informed or even know anything unless they
       went there and lived there and casually overheard a bit about the
       election on the Sun while standing in line at the register in the
       supermarket in their own little corner of the Sun.

       I saw that episode while waiting for the new X-Files episode. It
       was ok. I only say the first season of TWD and gave up on it. I
       guess the episode is getting good reviews because a kid was eaten
       by the zombies, and another kid was shot in the face. You normally
       don’t see that happen to kids in movies/tv.
       Other than that, it reminded me why I didn’t like TWD in the first
       place.
       The formula of the show seems to be, the group arrives to a safe
       zone/building, they live there for a while, start bickering with
       one another, the zombies break in, some supporting characters are
       eaten, they flee the place, find a new safe zone/building, and the
       cycle starts over.

       I kept reading it going “this has to be a joke, this has to be a

       Times.
       Dude, it has to be satire.
       Exhibit A) “Empire” and “Jedi” had nothing parodistic; their absurd
       earnestness and the bombastic banality of their direction (by Irvin
       Kershner and Richard Marquand, respectively) are a perfect match
       for the oppressive, hectoring John Williams scores that accompanied
       them.

       I wouldn’t mind that if the show didn’t try to take itself
       seriously and / or at least had fun doing it.
       That’s why I was talking about the S5 opener, because that was a
       beam of hope for the show. After 4 years, Rick finally says: “They
       just fucked with the wrong people, Coral” and the new season kicks
       off with explosions, tension, cannibalism and thank god nobody
       talks this time around.
       The only talking episode that was close to stellar was when they
       decided they gonna break the group apart and have couple of
       episodes, each focusing on two or three people; Daryl and the
       blonde girl had pretty great moments, because it seemed like the
       show forget how to dumb and actually reflected on their lives and

       “The Predator writer/director Shane Black re-teaming with co-writer
       Fred Dekker is certainly a cult film fan’s dream, as Black
       portrayed Hawkins in the original film and the two men co-wrote
       1987’s The Monster Squad. (Dekker is also responsible for the cult
       classic Night Of The Creeps.) The new film is being called ”an
       inventive sequel” rather than a reboot”

       So, reflecting upon Anakin Skywalker’s various accents…
       I can accept that he was born with an [DEL: American :DEL] Low
       Tatooine accent. Or whatever. And I can accept that his voice
       modulator made his voice into a baritone Afrian American accent
       (the Africanamerica system presumably being the planet Lando and
       Mace Windu were from).
       What I want to know is when did he pick up the [DEL: British :DEL]

       “The Oscars almost never get it right. Alfred Hitchcock never won
       one; Elaine May has never won one.
       And that’s just the opening lines.
       Then he disparages “Do the Right Thing” – cause the only acting
       nomination in it was a white guy – Danny Aiello.
       The guy acting the role, designated as a supporting one, without
       which there is no movie.
       Then he goes all “J’accuse!” by throwing such “damning” lines as
       “No black woman has ever won Best Actress for a movie made by a
       black director.”
       That doesn’t sound like entitlement at all.
       Like that someone SHOULD win, and MUST win something based on what
       or who they ARE – instead of based on the merits of their work.
       How does that exactly go with the “nearly all black actors won
       Oscars when directed by white directors”… I’m not sure.
       It only makes sense if you imagine the Academy as dressed in white
       robes, pillowcases on their heads and congregating around a field
       of burning crosses.
       So when they give an Oscar or a nomination to the nigger, they are
       actually giving it to his massa.
       Wait… Soo… Aiello got Spike that best writing nom?
       Oh… wait… Did you know that the “Creed” is actually a “black”
       movie, and that honoring only Stallone from among its performers,
       the Academy is, in effect, declaring that the most important and
       accomplished part of the movie is the one that displays a white
       man’s experience.?
       I guess Rocky 1, 2, 3 and 4 (and 6) also declare that only white
       man’s experience matters – instead of all those black experiences
       that those movies are full of… oh… wait… the movies are titled
       Rocky… and this is a sequel to all those movies… with Rocky in
       them.
       Just like this movie has a Rocky in it.
       Then he goes on to poke fingers at movies that did not get
       nominated, shouting at the sky “Why don’t THESE ‘independent’
       movies get noms but movies like Beasts of the Southern Wild,
       Winter’s Bone, Juno and Little Miss Sunshine do? WHY?!”
       Oh… and the movies he pokes a finger at… it’s ONE movie – from
       1982.
       And two (black) directors one of whose latest feature is a movie
       that played at a single festival before going to DVD – in 2007.
       While the other’s latest feature is a date movie from 1999.
       BUT… He manages to disparage BOSW for its white director… but not
       for its white writer.
       White female writer.
       Like the white female writers of Juno and Winter’s Bone.
       Or the while female directors of Little Miss Sunshine and Winter’s
       Bone.
       Or the young white female actresses who got nominated for acting in
       those movies.
       And a young black actress.
       It’s as if those movies have something in common, right?
       Isn’t it fun when a sensitive Joss Whedon sticks his nose so far up
       his ass to better smell his own farts – he ends up with his own
       foot in his own mouth?
       And while that is fun, day only has 24 hours, so I’ll just mention
       that he manages to praise himself for being a part of crowd of
       critics who give out THEIR Creed award (most of whose nominations
       match those of the Oscars crowd) to Michael B. Jordan – while also
       nominating Sylvester Stallone.
       Then he goes on to praise Chi-Raq as Spike Lee’s best movie an to
       lament Samuel L. Jackson’s lack of Oscars (cause that motherfucker
       is known for his range and acting qualities – like playing bad
       motherfuckers who shout)…
       And then he argues how blacks should get more noms and awards –
       because Donald Trump and NRA and cause some hicks in Oregon decided
       to play-pretend a siege of a national park.
       I.e. Blacks should get awards solely because politics.
       Meaning not only that they should be GIVEN awards not on their own
       merits of acting, directing, writing and such (which would be
       awards that they would WIN) – but to show that all whites are not
       that bad.
       See? We’re not all Trump NRA hicks with guns.
       Look… we’re giving awards to black people – whether they are
       deserved or not.
       Which also validates why all those black actors and filmmakers
       mentioned earlier didn’t and shouldn’t have been awarded.
       No Trump card back then.

       It’s not accidental.
       If you stick your head so far up your ass that you think that the
       prequels are arthouse movies – so you watch them with the the sound
       off, so that the “hectoring” music (if you need to sum up
       pretentiousness to a word – using Iliad slang where common words
       would do is the way to go) doesn’t get in the way of your enjoyment
       of CGI fights.
       It’s not accidental at all.
       It’s an example of someone so out of touch with reality (he admits
       never seeing Star Wars movies prior to that, other than the first
       one long ago) and so willing to praise his own egotistical delusion

       I finally watched Space Cop.
       It’s fine. Some jokes worked, others didn’t or went on too long.
       All the craft and special effects were very cute. Overall I enjoyed
       watching it, although my personal stake in a film called “Space
       Cop” – which was directed by, written by, edited by, and acted by
       basically all the same people – was extremely low to begin with.
       There’s quite a difference between talking about films and actually
       making one; especially when all creative aspects of the film fall
       on your shoulders, and money and time are both probably hard to
       budget.
       Well done. You guys made a movie. By yourselves. It was probably a
       huge pain in the ass.
     * Red Skeleton
       As I said in my review of it, the casting was SUPERB… all the bit
       parts were filled by people who were perfect for their roles, which
       is what they were going for.
     * Red Skeleton
       As far as the jokes going on for too long, I know from the
       commentary that
       A) the bit with Patton Oswalt going on and on about Space Cop just
       standing there staring at him was improvised by him. And then Jack
       stared impovising off Patton Oswalt. I guess when a famous (or at
       least established) comedian starts improvising in your movie you
       don’t leave the footage on teh cutting room floor.
       B) The homosexual innuendo bit in the hotel… Jay actually WANTED to
       cut it but he got vetoed by a test audience liking it. I have to
       say I agreed with Jay, that bit WAS unfunny but the perfect edit to
       the (again, well cast) hotel staff member staring at them made it
       work. Work, not made it funny.
     * Sheriff Mitchell
       Yep, and it’s not like I was outraged by a few jokes going on too
       long. Some fell flat, but others didn’t and got genuine laughs out
       of me. Again: Written by, Directed by, Acted by the same people. I
       was more than willing to stomach a few strikeouts if it meant I
       could see a couple homeruns.

       I don’t think there is anything inherently wrong with excessive
       action in movies as long as it’s done right. I’m sure most here
       would agree that Mad Max: Fury Road was a great movie and that
       movie is 90% chases sequence from start to finish. That said unlike
       some action movies you’re invested in the characters and their
       motivations. Even with a bunch of shit on screen during the big
       action set pieces we as the audience can tell what is happening on
       screen and are not lost in the disorienting shaky cam. However, I
       do agree movies need to stop trying to just sell themselves on just
       action alone. Then again Transformers had a new trilogy green lite
       so what the fuck do I know. #HuckFollywood

       You know how I know it? Because I saw Furious 7 three times. It has
       2 big action pieces, one big heist scene and all of them involve
       around 6 – 7 people (of the main cast) and random number of
       villains / baddies, yet you know all the time who is who, what are

       Remember a few days back the news about “London Town Council voted
       to leave EU”?
       Sounds big… huge… Town Council. Of London.
       Must be some big thing that the Brits have that runs their capitol.
       It was actually an equivalent of a municipality council of a single
       East London municipality (borough actually) – of which London has
       33.
       That entire borough is some 245.000 people.
       Entire Greater London is 8.5 million people.
       Both Glastonbury and Havering borough are drops in a bucket.

       Oh, sure it is. I am not saying it’s a number of people that could
       be that important, nor am I saying that the festival is more
       important than the vote.
       But there ain’t many events in UK this big and this long. Plus the
       date was set months ago. All I am saying it could have been planned
       better, rather than throwing the responsibility of possibility to
       vote on organizers.

       I just loose interest the moment anything blows up anymore or they
       introduce a portal that spawns crap that fires rockets and
       whatever. I don’t think I have seen an action movie that I like
       since Matrix 1999. The first Iron Man movie was alot of fun because
       it had a raw and aggressive tone. But it was just lost in a
       blizzard of Marvel Universe sh**. Mad Max was an exeption and it
       was wonderful but I can’t say I like it since watching it again.
       The only action I truly enjoy nowadays is the Ghost in the Shell
       series.

       It’s not their responsibility any more that it’s the responsibility
       of the local supermarket.
       They are not Australia, where (in theory) you can be fined for not
       voting.
       Nor is the attendance of the festival obligatory.
       At worst, GF could complain if the attendance drops, blaming the
       gubermint for sabotage… but something tells me that ain’t gonna
       happen.

       expect them to get their ass kicked/be killed
     * Tapeworm
       Hollywood action is what it is, overblown and obnoxious without any
       sense of stakes (most of the time and I don’t really count Fury
       Road as Hollywood). For engaging action, it’s all about the evil
       foreigners (even though sometimes directed by eviler caucasians).

       Chicken.
       And by chicken I mean a not full grown chicken but no longer a

       About 4 weeks old.

       eg
       I was about 4 years old. So that rhymes I guess.
       We went to visit cousins who lived in a village. They had chickens,
       you know… like one does in a countryside household.
       So, my dad though it would be great fun to tell me to go and catch
       one chicken so we’d take it home.
       Now, I doubt he was thinking all Rocky there, but I sure wasn’t.
       I just went down the yard, got one of the longest sticks I could
       find (there was a pile of those, few meters long, used for growing
       tomatoes), took my position in the middle of the yard and – whacked
       the chicken which tried to run along the length of the barn wall.
       Problem solved!

       There ARE plenty old mine shafts around but they are tricky to get

       openings of the shafts, as the ground around them is not secured in
       any way and you might end up at the bottom of the shaft yourself.
       Only favorable condition is all the graveyards in the neighborhood
       – but they are all up the hill, you can’t get to most plots with a
       car AND all are surrounded by thousands of windows.

       DECKARD: I challenge you to a duel by combat. If I lose, you get
       Los Angeles. If I win, your army agrees to stand down and cancel
       the invasion. It’s the Neo-Replicant way.
       ZARGON, NEO-REPLICANT LEADER: Certainly, you know our ways. So be
       it, trial by combat it is. A duel to the death on the Lazergrid!

       transformed into a landscape of neon blue and green wire-frames)
       ZARGON (laughing as a wire-frame space-fighter materializes around
       him) Choose your weapons, Deckard! While you still can! (flies up
       and performs loop-de-loop in mid-air, then starts bearing down on
       Deckard’s positions, fires bolts of Lazergrid at him as Deckard
       materializes an attack helicopter around him in neon-yellow
       gridlines and flies upward to commence the opening dogfight)

       Maybe he just enjoys doing the whole thing without having to worry
       about how he acts.
       “Fuck it. I’ll phone it in. Cause I can. What are they gonna do?

       First time hearing that Ridley Scott won’t be directing it. I
       thought Blade Runner was his wet dream (ya know, ’cause it’s
       rainy). Any theories as to why he chose another director?
     * TheManHole
       Yeah Bruce Willis could not look any less interested with making
       movies if he tried. Have you seen him in the Red 2 interview?
     * Like Icare
       To be honest, he’s probably just bored with what most people keep
       associating him with.
       Those clips of him flying and talking about flying, you can see he
       really likes that and he likes talking about that.
       And that’s a bit of a loner’s thing.
       And not having to work for money (or anything else really) for
       decades he probably just tires of people (and the image they all
       have of him) more quickly now.
       Remember when he made “What Lies Beneath”?
       I kinda get the feeling that’s his attitude to the audience.
       “You think you know me cause you saw me in movies? Fuck you. You
       don’t know shit about me.”

       Well… IMDB currently lists one done by Untitled Neill Blomkamp and

       Scott’s has Fassbender and Danny McBride, Blomkamp’s has Sigourney
       Weaver and Michael Biehn.
       Scott is supposed to be producing BOTH for 2017.
       I doubt that both will happen.

       Regarding laughing at the explodin’ varmints: there was an article
       a few years back, probably in the 90s, about how ‘Generation X’
       laughs at trauma because we weren’t properly trained how to deal
       with trauma. We’ve lived such cushy protected lives that when we
       see something horrific, our response is to dismiss it as
       impossible, which makes it farcical.
       Wish I could find that article. It was one of the spate of warnings
       that were written about the extension of adolescence (people in
       their 30s having ‘cupcake parties’ and so forth) that we all
       ignored, and which led directly to the current hellish state of

       I’m more of a fan of the Lugosi and Lee depiction of vampires. As
       dark lords. Ruler of “the night and its beasts”. That kind of
       vampires. Blade is not as bad as Twillight…but from my perspective
       they are both far away from what I imagine to be acceptable vampire
       movies. The anime “Vampire Hunter D” and its sequel “Bloodlust” are
       pretty spot on for me, too. In theory I should like the “Van
       Hellsing” movie but I don’t. Movie is garbage even it has
       everything in it to be a good vampire movie. Maybe because it’s
       more of a comedy as a serious horror movie. And Dracula reminded me
       more of a shifty car salesman instead of the prince of darkness.

       I think that the orange version is concentrating on the “package”
       aspect of it, along with the “he likes fat chicks” angle, making it
       all about “sexy thing”… and not about him playing a stereotypical
       lower class Britt.
       Although, that black shirt and that hairstyle blending into that
       black background… it looks like he’s wearing the upper half of a
       scuba suit.

       Following the new line of youtube products, after Poo The Pie and
       Unicorn Shit Something, Dramatic Chipmunk will be made into its own
       miniseries.
       And then the world will finally realize the inherent poetic beauty
       of Exploding Varmints.

       I know someone asked about Shia and where he is these days… well,
       apparently, in an elevator!
       “Shia LaBeouf is spending 24 hours in an elevator in Oxford
       University. He is due to give a talk there on 19 February at 8pm,
       and for the 24 hours either side of it, will be occupying the
       elevator at EC English Oxford in Gloucester Green (OX1 2BT) with
       collaborators Rönkkö & Turner.
       Visitors will be able to join LaBeouf, Rönkkö & Turner inside the
       elevator during this time, and are invited to address the artists,
       the debating chamber, and the internet, so that their collective
       voices may form an extended, expansive and egalitarian Oxford Union
       address.”
       He really elevated the performance act, didn’t he?
     * Like Icare

       You know what would be funny?
       If there’s a medical emergency during that time. And someone needs
       to be urgently transported with that elevator. And then they can’t.
       And then they die.
       It would be just like exploding varmints!
     * Doctor Andre Son of Thomas.
       Fuck I was just joking. I didnt expect him to do something. damn it
       now I have to keep making stupid movies.

       On the bright side, Shia would finally make an impact on someone’s

       I really don’t want to hate on the guy, if for no other reason then

       But he also comes off as such a douche…
     * tOmy`
       He does, doesn’t he?
       I have no problem with him (except that whole rape story), but
       frankly: This is how performance art looks like.
       Just because he was in Transformers, we shouldn’t forget he just
       sorta does… stuff… others have done.

       Mark Strong is very bald. I mean, it’s obvious he’s bald, but it’s
       like there’s a stronger than usual emphasis on his particular,
       specific baldness. I mean, you could put him in a room full of bald
       guys and his baldness is so intense people would be able to
       immediately pick him out of the crowd, simply because of his
       high-energy baldness aura.
     * tOmy`
       Okay, honest question. Who is the winner out of these:
       1) Notting Hill
       2) You’ve Got Mail

       It’s not just the Transformers.
       For a while there he was the go-to sidekick kid – which is
       basically his role in the Transformers as well.
       I Robot, Constantine, Indiana Jones, Wall Street 2… even Lawless.
       At the same time, to quote Adam Sandler, he didn’t progress.
       It’s all the same annoying kid character, shouting “NONONONONO!”
       He just became grating. Or always was. It’s hard to tell.

       I gave you 4 instances, across history and cultures off the top of
       my head.
       Feel free to look up more examples and cultural artifacts of humans
       finding joy in the pains of others, there are plenty of them.
       You could start by looking up Schadenfreude (or epicaricacy in
       English – which is word borrowed from Greek language, as many 19th
       century scientific and philosophical terms are, as it was still one
       of the two main languages of science back then) and synonymous
       expressions across cultures and time.
       [637]https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schadenfreude
       We are emphatic creatures. We got neural hardware just for that.
       [638]https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mirror_neuron
       That same hardware which makes us feel the pain of others as our
       own, also allows us to get vicarious joy from actions of others AND
       to get catharsis from witnessing the misfortunes of others.
       Particularly when we feel that they are getting their “just
       rewards”.
       Like watching Scorsese movies.
       Where we get to both vent our anger when Joe Pesci murders someone
       in anger AND to feel righteous “all is right with the world”
       feeling when we witness him getting his comeuppance.
       I mention Scorsese cause he actually does that on purpose (he
       mentions it in the commentary to Casino… I think) – but it works
       for any story with a clear “bad guy”.
       We want the bad guy to die horribly BUT we want it to be a
       “deserved” punishment – so we would feel no negative emotions while
       getting a kick from witnessing murder of another human being.
