   Jack and Rich play Rocket League, which is possibly the most funnest
   game ever.

       One day when I tell my great-grandchildren that I was there at the
       very beginning of the Bearded Rich Evans era, they probably won’t
       believe me.

     * Palpatine
       Yay, new content, oh, it’s just Pre-Rec.

     * Palpatine
       All joking aside, I don’t hate Pre Rec at all.
     * Wizard Phoenix
       As a person who has played the game there isn’t a lot of cutscenes.
       It’s like MGS4 when the final cutscene clocked in over an hour.
     * Dan Hibiki
       MEDIOCRE!

       The intro/start of the game had a really bad pace, but other than
       that, it’s pretty ok.
     * Wizard Phoenix
       I love how Rich’s shirt is too big for him.
     * Wizard Phoenix
       The beginning was great and well paced and then how they get back
       into the world was a bit odd. After that flawless pacing.
     * Palpatine
       Who’s mediocre?
     * James Earl Jones
       New content! Yay!
       Now, if we could get some BOTW goodness in the next couple of
       hours…
     * Palpatine
       I love how Jack has his mic taped to his shirt.
     * Palpatine
       Yes. This.
     * James Earl Jones
       Thank you, Susan.

       Yay, new contempt!

       I just bougth this game yesterday coincidentally, It’s a blast! I
       agree with everything you guys said.

       Now Rich has me thinking about his ass and flowers. FUCK YOU, RICH!

     * paintitswe
       Jack and Rich you should play Elite: Dangerous! I would love to
       hear your thought on it.
     * Palpatine
       Does it have cutscenes in it?
     * Wizard Phoenix

     * Palpatine
       I wonder if Rich and Jack will review the new Star Wars game when
       it comes out?
     * dollar store cashier wife
       Do you mean Lego Star Wars Episode VII:the video game?
     * Like Icare
       How can you be snobby European by calling sportsball sportsball?
       It’s sportsball!
       What are you supposed to call it? Sportsball? What is that even
       supposed to mean?
       Sportsball is sportsball. There’s nothing snobby or “European”
       about that.
     * Palpatine
       No, Battlegrounds or whatever it’s called.
     * Bubs
       So if we’re to take this “review” of Rocket League at face value,
       we would all believe that Rocket League is a perfect game designed
       by angels. It’s not.
       It’s a really good game, and I highly recommend it because it’s a
       lot of fun. But you didn’t point out ANY of the flaws of the game.
       Like constant leavers, issues with the bot AI, or the lack of
       additional game modes. Can’t have any of THAT in a review, now can
       we?
     * Palpatine
       I was waiting for you to comment.
     * Bubs
       I hope I satisfied you.

       you make is great sure go for it.
     * Wizard Phoenix
       Still it’s 3 AM
     * Palpatine
       Wow, that was really cool!
     * Wizard Phoenix
       It lacked Rogers and Clarke from Ishtar performing.
     * Bubs
       That’s true… maybe I should first do a review show about Hot Dogs,
       since that’s what I REALLY know. Then once that takes off, I’ll
       switch over to something completely unrelated, but pretend like I
       still know what I’m talking about.

       While they were probably right about Rocket League’s servers being
       deserted in a year, and populated by ultra pros who will skull fuck
       you, this shouldn’t dissuade you from buying the game. Why? Well,
       let me tell you!
       Because – and this is another thing they didn’t even mention –
       Rocket League has fucking PC LOCAL COOP! (Which is unheard of,
       because who has friends over anymore, amiright?) So even if you
       can’t find a good game online, you can still play with your
       boyfriend/girlfriend/brother/sister/creepy uncle Joe. Plus, who
       cares what the game is like in a year? It’s fun right fuckin now.
       As a note: Not picking on you. I’m just sayin’.
     * Like Icare
       What is this “friends over” you’re talking about?
       Is that like an app? Do I need a Facebook for that?
       Can I put it in my 4K teevee with my you-ass-be hidmee?
       Cause I’d like it to be in 4 Ks and not in some lesser number of
       Ks.
     * TapewormBike
       Yeah, close. Except we look cooler on the dancefloor.
     * TapewormBike
       Skimming the comments – why would you want to hear about MGS V?
       Cars hit balls! WEEEEE!

       Car crashes resulting in testicular injury are not a wee matter.

       MGSV has boobies. To quote an Italian filmmaker “I WANT TO SEE
       BOOBIES!”
     * TapewormBike
       And the soundtrack is tits as well
     * Palpatine
       And does this game have boobies? No! It doesn’t! Because it’s for
       eight year old kids, that’s why.
     * TapewormBike
       Luckily, my mental age corresponds with that.
     * Wizard Phoenix
       The Witcher 3 has multiple boobies!
     * TapewormBike
       Is there a Total Recall game?
     * Wizard Phoenix
       Yes but it’s on the NES and it sucks ass balls.
     * Palpatine
       Mine is more like twelve, which is why I like violence and boobs in
       my games.

       Rich mentioning N64 and Doom to awaken the old people in the room.

       “Ass balls”. That’s an AVGN word, isn’t it?

       Yes, I use them a lot. Shitload of fuck is one I use too often.

       I enjoy his stuff, especially his horror movie reviews he does
       every October.
     * Wizard Phoenix
       He’ll never review Rainbow’s Remedy.
     * TapewormBike
       Rolfe is a cool guy. Can’t say I am that into AVGN, but his movie
       stuff is great. It oozes fandom more than critical analysis and I
       for one am OK with that.
     * Palpatine
       You don’t man, that’s a pretty scary movie right there.
     * Palpatine
       Agreed.

       You know, gamer people, what are your favorite games like ever? I
       would tell you mine but you call me a freak.
     * TapewormBike
       I am not a gamer, but I am a freak and it seriously is MGS2. Yes, I
       said it.
     * Palpatine
       I have a lot of nostalgia for the games from Sony’s Big Three. You
       know, the ones from the early 2000’s.
     * Wizard Phoenix
       The big three being a space cannon and two Death Stars?
     * Palpatine
       If you were a kid in the early 2000’s, you’d know what I’m talking
       about.
     * Wizard Phoenix
       So Jak and Daxter, Crash Bandicoot, and Ratchet and Clank.
     * Palpatine
       I didn’t play Crash, but I did play the other two along with Sly
       Cooper. Did you?
     * RLMkeepitup
       I remember playing the Oregon Trail in elementary,wolfenstein in

       No I was busy playing this smart game called Halo 2.

       Me too at first and I was subscribed to the official playstation
       magazine
     * RLMkeepitup
       that must’ve been fun. I still have a copy of UT 2004 on my desktop
       cause its a good shooter and low requirements
     * TapewormBike
       PS2 is where I dropped off, PS1 was my gaming highlight. I had the
       sub to Official Playstation Magazine as well. Demo discs were like
       half of my collection.
     * TapewormBike
       Carnally?
     * Wizard Phoenix
       It was and the campaign for every game is some of the best single
       player stuff out there. Even Halo 4 who had the dumbest villain
       ever.
     * Palpatine
       I don’t know what that word means, so no.
     * RLMkeepitup
       you could play the entire campaign split screen or over live for
       several of the games. few games even today offer that

       Final Fantasy Tactics. (Original PS version with bad translation
       ONLY, not the updated Gameboy Advance one)
       I have seriously played that game 10… maybe 20 times and the game
       is a little different every fucking time. It’s so awesome. I would
       buy it dinner, fuck it, and marry it the next day. It’s a perfect
       game up until you meet Orlandu, who literally is so powerful the
       rest of the game is broken. But you can just choose not to put him
       in your party, then the game is perfect.
       ETA: Just talking about it made me want to go play it again.

       Yes. Most people don’t know this, but Jack has a rare allergy to

       Oh lots of games for so many different reasons.
       Civ 2 was a great little strategy game whose simple architecture
       helped me learn how those things worked. I loved fucking around,
       modding the ini files and the graphics to create little units,
       rename technologies, and create all kinds of little scenarios
       powered by the engine.
       Dark Souls introduced me to Miyazaki’s wonderful sense of design
       and direction. The game is a modern masterpiece where the game
       environment itself propels and informs the narrative rather than a
       bunch of dialogue trees. Oddly apropos since the game has a
       multiplayer element that is still more active than you’d expect
       more than three years after its launch.
       Wing Commander Privateer. An open galaxy MS DOS game where you
       could be a space pirate who sells slaves to mines and drugs to star
       bases in a customized ship you bought. What more could you want!
       Ogre Battle on SNES. It hit that strategy and rpg sweetspot with a
       wide cast of units and characters. It also had that Japanese art
       style in the spritework that was reminiscent of other games with
       great art direction like Secret of Mana. It was kind of on the easy
       side, however.
       Maniac Mansion for NES was my introduction to the adventure game
       genre and I still feel a fondness for it. It’s actually a little
       funnier to play as an adult because the cheese that went over my
       head as a kid is actually very endearing. Almost everything made
       with the LucasArts scumm engine is memorable.
       Baldur’s Gate introduced me to Bioware. Which was a great
       relationship all the way to Mass Effect 3.

       I’ve noticed people are talking about the vidya games. I recall

       video games can’t be art. Well, anyway, he won the argument by
       dying before anyone could convince him otherwise, but asshole
       journalists and bloggers everywhere still consider the eternal
       question: What’s in my popcorn tub?
       Do you consider games art? Do you not? Do you give a shit? If you
       do, why, and what games would you say have reached that artistic
       merit?
       Post a comment on my comment, and I’ll send you a link to The Great

     * dollar store cashier wife
       Games are definitely art. One of the definions of that damned word
       basically allows to call any creative expression that triggers
       somekind of emotional response art so really games should not be
       nowhere near regarded with the kind of contempt people like Ebert
       spew. As far as my own takeaway I think the best examples of
       artistic games comes from those developers that understand the main
       advantage/what sets out games from other artistic mediums is first
       and foremost interactivity. The amount of games that are able to
       gel gameplay and story into meaningfully coexisting unity is not
       big but they do exist and here’s some examples:
       Silent Hill 2, Hotline Miami, Brothers-A Tale of Two Sons, Portal,
       Dark Souls, Papers Please,

     * bleurgh
       Games are art simply by existing. It’s a medium of original content
       created by people i.e art. Just like all movies and tv shows are
       art. The term doesn’t just apply to stuff that’s good. If I draw a
       picture of a dick it’s a piece of art. It might be juvenile and
       shitty, but it’s art nonetheless. Ebert was wrong basically. You
       assemble an ikea cabinet it’s not art, but if you create something
       unique it’s a piece of art, doesn’t matter what the fuck it is. It
       could be something completely utilitarian like a table. If it’s
       unique it’s art. If you created it your an artist. It may be a
       broad way of looking at things, but every other definition I’ve
       heard is too easy to poke holes in.

       I’m not sure anyone could make a convincing case against video
       games being art. If dubstep is art, then you bet your grandma’s
       tits that video games are.
       However, Jonathan Blow gave a great talk at GDC one year about how,
       while video games are an artform, they’ve yet to really reach their
       full potential. And while I think he’s a bit of a blow hard (no pun
       intended), I agree with him on that. Video Games are, more often
       than not, the lowest form of entertainment. Just look at the 75
       million copies of Call of Duty sold every year. But, we’re seeing
       more and more video games break out of that “shoot things get
       points” box. A great game that comes to mind is the The Stanley
       Parable. It’s a clever rumination on the tropes and pitfalls of
       videogaming and design.
       Currently, too much time is being focused on “Makin’ it luk reel”,
       as if that was important somehow. I’m sorry, but it’s just not the
       case. Playstation One graphics were shit, yet everyone felt
       something when Aeris died in Final Fantasy 7. Our games don’t need
       to look like mirror images of real life for us to connect with
       them. Games don’t work like that. Movies do. So, I think it will be
       a long time before “artform” video games become the norm.

       The problem with MP is only partially “other people” although
       certainly having to deal with one griefer one time is more than
       anyone should ever have to, and if you do have committed gaming
       friends who like the same games you do and are on the exact same
       schedule as you (unlikely once you are an adult) then at least you
       can avoid the core consumer base whose sadism addiction requires
       them to ruin the game for others.
       One big problem is the fundamental design. Single player games can
       present truly challenging gameplay, but because “balanced play” is
       the foundation of multiplayer they cannot. This is why most MP
       games abandon all gameplay and focus on providing an arena. MP
       games aren’t really games.
       The biggest problem with multiplayer is the target audience. It’s
       pretty telling in how hypersensitive dedicated MP gamers are. They
       know they like casual shallow products and pointing it out makes
       them aggressively defensive. There is no objective difference
       between something like this and Candy Crush or any of the thousands
       of FPS games out there. They are shallow experiences and once
       you’ve played for five minutes you’ve experienced everything the
       game has to offer – something the designers are quick to hide under
       layers of grinding.

       its just that movies often attempt to reflect real life whereas a

       Funny you should mention Final Fantasy 7. Like most games I’m 20
       years late in playing it but I actually experienced the “Aeris
       death scene” for the first time only recently. It was strange. I
       knew it was coming. It’s one of the worst kept “secrets” (spoilers,
       whatever) in gaming, and yet I actually really did feel something.
       I didn’t cry, as I don’t usually, but I was close to. She’d been a
       constant throughout the game, a likeable character and a nice love
       interest throughout the game, then bam, dead, completely. Hit hard.
       Anyway, the look of games will develop over time I think. They’ll
       come a point when we hit the uncanny valley too much, so different
       designs will start appearing (for example, the absolutely gorgeous
       (imo) Okami) and even though FF7 is blocky, there is at least a
       style to it, which I really appreciate in a game as old as it is.
       I agree for the most part that most games are yet to reach an
       “artform” but I think there are some games out there that have
       every right to be called “art”. I guess we just need to let it all
       develop with time, and allow the gaming library to increase more
       and moreso.

       I have similar feelings. I’ve always thought that anything a human
       built from their imagination, no matter how mundane, is still art.
       I suppose the debate is really if video games are “high art”, but
       then, there was a time when Shakespeare’s plays, prose literature ,
       and film were all considered “lowbrow”. I just find it funny that
       people like Ebert could fall into the same trap people did years
       ago.

     * Taylor Evans
       I feel like they can be art, but in the artistic discussion I feel
       like people focus too much on it as a storytelling medium in its
       artistic merits. My examples would be how many games have you going
       around being a mass murderer while your character laments death.
       Now, of course, these games have to have action to keep them
       interesting and of course they should be able to tell a story, but
       there’s often times such a divorce between the character you’re
       playing as and the one in cut scenes that it’s jarring if you’re
       trying to view it as a story as a whole. Red Dead Redemption is
       actually a great example of this. If you want to view a character’s
       play through as the story as a whole John Marsten kills a ton of
       people before being shot down by the fledgling FBI and could really
       be the reason why they did that.
       Where I think there are more artistic merits in gaming is that it’s
       the only medium in which you can actually feel like you are what
       you’re playing as. I think more artistic games should focus on
       getting you to empathize with your character through means of
       gameplay than means of story through forced cutscenes.

       I thought Spec Ops The Line did a pretty decent job here.
       I hope that as games progress, the writing will improve in more
       games, so that the character will reflect upon YOUR actions more
       and more. Spec Ops being an example. You shoot a guy, then later
       on, the story’s ending will happen as a consequence of YOU, not the
       character, shooting the guy. It’s an interesting concept in any
       case.
       To mention a point you made earlier, about how people only really
       talk about storytelling, it bothers me that visual design isn’t
       really brought up enough when talking about games as an art form.
       Even games made on very dated systems still look good today (imo)
       because of the visual design. Examples being Final Fantasy 7,
       Fallout 1 and 2, Planescape Torment, hell even Ocarina of Time.

       I just don’t get how someone like him, who a lot of the time was

       an entire medium couldn’t be art.
     * Marvin Falz
       You can copy a piece of music infinitely and the piece is still
       unique and it is still art. The same applies to video games,
       although I would say that a video game’s function is first and
       foremost to entertain the player(s) and maybe secondly function as
       a work of art. I think the function of art is to make you think,
       reflect on yourself and the world and maybe secondly to entertain.
       On the other hand I’d call a game like Banjo-Kazooie art, because
       it is well-constructed, each world follows a theme, which is
       reflected in the landscapes, the architectural style of buildings,
       the colors, the characters and their “voices”, the ambient noises
       and the soundtrack. When you’re in Mad Monster Mansion you get that
       creepy feeling of graveyard site but in a fun way since it’s a fun
       game. And when you listen to the soundtrack of Freezeezy Peak you
       imagine winter and snow.
       Another example I’d like to call art is Morrowind. There is a
       plethora of geographical, historical and political background
       information on Vvardenfell. You get an idea where to place yourself
       in all of this during the main quest. The game doesn’t only tell
       you that you’re the rectifying hero but it gives you enough
       material all over the land via dialogue and books that extend your
       identification with the hero. It is almost like you are the main
       character in a playable novel.

       ability is what makes them fun.

       So, after hanging out with a group of Star Wars fans for a bit, I
       came up with a thought.
       Do you think Han, Luke, and Leia are all going to live through The
       Force Awakens, or do you think they’re gonna kill at least one of
       them off to make more room for the new cast and story?
       I made a bet that Han and Leia were going to die somehow, but Luke
       was going to stay. Just wanted to know what you guys thought.
     * dollar store cashier wife
       Hopefully they’all die and episode VIII will be about something
       else other then mindless fan service.

     * Wizard Phoenix
       Luke I think, Han because Harrison is a grandpa maybe not. Kylo
       “Most Likely A Solo Kid” Ren is probably going to have a murderous
       rage similar to Max Landis’ rage towards RLM.
     * Palpatine
       I think Han will die. That’s only because Harrison Ford never liked
       the character.
     * Wizard Phoenix
       Harrison likes the character actually but he thinks that Han dying
       seems fitting to him. It is when you think about it. Some one like
       him that’s cheated death multiple times should get what’s coming to
       them.
     * Palpatine
       I hope the literally old characters have as little screen time as
       possible. That way we can get to know the new ones better.

       Harrison wanted Han to die in Empire, but since the character was
       so popular, it never happened.
     * Wizard Phoenix

       That would be too anticlimactic for a modern movie. Instead he will
       be split in half, falling backwards down a reactor shaft. Who cares
       what it rhymes with. They may as well kill him like Porkins; with a
       jug of soda and a bag of fries in his hands.

       Do fans really want the new characters to be related to the OT

       story of the Skywalker family, I guess.
     * Wizard Phoenix

     * Hank_Henshaw
       They will die 1 per movie. Han for VII, Leia for VIII, Luke for IX.
       It’s like poetry.
     * Wizard Phoenix
       I don’t want it always about them. I think it’s better to create
       something new to be attached to rather than let’s rely on the
       things everyone knows. If you don’t do something new you get Star
       Trek Into Darkness.
     * Hank_Henshaw
       Every message board I read about Star Wars (unavoidable these days)
       there are so many comments about fans speculating which of the new
       characters is the son/daughter of which known character. By the
       way, BB-8 is the (adoptive) son of R2-D2 and C-3PO, you heard it
       here first.
     * instant relief
       I will never look in the mirror again! What’s wrong with my face?
     * Wizard Phoenix
       I would like it if Rey or Finn are not related to anyone from the
       Original Trilogy because it goes back to what Mister Plinkett said
       about Protagonus. You need someone who’s normal for people to
       relate to. With Rey we can see our normal people are dealing post
       Jedi and with Finn we can see what the First Order is like post
       Jedi. That doesn’t mean she isn’t going to be a Solo or Skywalker
       but that shit will probably be reveal far later after we get to
       know as a human being.

       they’ll like it.
     * Wizard Phoenix
       As I said they still can be but I have a feeling that’s not going
       to be part of their character because they’ve probably been very
       far removed from their family or some shit. Whatever fart.

       You guys play stupid video games. Either review nostalgic shit or

       IDGAF about rocket league and I really don’t think anyone else does
       either. Your review of Arkham Knight was much better, even though I
       didn’t agree with you. This isn’t about your opinion of the game
       (and by this I mean my complaint, not your show). I just think your
       show is boring because you review stuff no one cares about… without
       being funny the way Wheel of the Worst and Half in the Bag are when
       they review bullshit. I know at least Rich knows how to do this, so
       come on… or maybe you don’t care if anyone likes it? Maybe its just

       Luke, Leia and Han to all die in first movie – 0% chance.
       Han alone to die in first movie – 0% chance.
       He’s Han SoloTM now. He’ll never die. Like Mickey Mouse. Or at
       least not in the first movie.
       Particularly since they went out of their way to include him in
       that poster.

       Good god… Who Drew that? That’s right, Struzan.
       Luke to die in any of future movies – 99% chance.
       They can always force-ghost him back… so if some killing off is
       needed to raise the tension – pop goes the Luke.
       And they HAVE TO have a Jedi Master in the trilogy to train the new
       Jedi(s).
       So, his death will mean SOMETHING to some one. Not just the old
       characters.
       Who PROBABLY don’t even know about the whole Space Ghost thing.
       They probably just think that he’s senile when they see him talking
       to the air or smiling at empty walls.
       So he may die, but it would be an ultimately irrelevant death.
       Will he die in the first movie? Not likely.
       There simply won’t be enough time for introduction of all those new
       characters and all those toys (kids and other retards have to see
       toys in order to want them), the plot, the MacGuffin,
       RE-introduction of Solo, Luke and Leia (who apparently are NOT
       sharing a condo on Coruscant), them meeting all of these new
       characters (or those of importance) – AND for Luke to establish any
       kind of relationship with his future student for his death to mean
       anything to any of the new characters.
       So, if they have a blind monkey on the set as a script consultant –
       Luke will probably not die in the first movie.
       If all they have is Jar Jar… Sorry, all I can think of is how much
       I would like to cut him up into pieces and then light them on fire
       while the rest of him watches…
       Yeah… Luke dies. Fuck you Jar Jar Abrams.
       Where was I? Ah… yes…
       Leia to die in the first movie – depending on who she turns out to
       be.
       If she is a mother of one or more characters (WHAT A TWIST!) – her
       chances to die will rise dramatically.
       Particularly since all other characters are teenagers.
       Who are supposed to be heading out on an epic adventure and not
       staying home taking care of their aging parents.
       If there is such a link it must be severed, possibly also giving
       the young character a motivation of revenge. And we all know how
       much Jar Jar likes making it about REVENGE!
       If she’s just Han Solo’s wife… She might still die (REVENGE!!!) but
       not immediately.
       And if Luke dies she does not. Because, something-something
       Skywalker…
       These are my opinions.

       Actions: Things to do to or make people do. ‘Give them shoos’ ‘Put
       them in camps.’ “Teach them to play *SPORTS*’ETC
       Then Reasons: ‘For economic growth’ ‘For a laugh’ ‘Because i hate
       the French!’
       Then Race:
       pick one piece of paper from each bag.
       Then you have to ‘Spin’ the race card.
       “Thats right i want to ‘give crack’ to ‘The French’, ‘Because they
       are made of sperm.”
       then you have to justify or “Spin” your statement.

       20 year projections for unemployment in France show a steady rise
       while productivity keeps dropping.
       In order to increase productivity and decrease the number of
       prospective unemployed French citizens, cocaine (in crack form, for
       stability) should be introduced at workplaces.
       It will increase productivity and decrease male libido and
       spermatogenesis, thus reducing future unemployment while increasing
       worker productivity.

       Yeah, I’m actually of the opinion that Obi Wan being the one who
       killed Lukes father is a much better twist than Darth Vadar being
       Lukes father. It’s such a more brutal betrayal, Luke loses his
       mentor in that instant and is left to wonder if the destruction of
       the Vadar and the Empire is something he ever actually cared about
       or if he was just being manipulated by an evil old man to settle an
       ancient score. Eventually he’d come to the conclusion that Obi was
       trying to help him out of guilt and realises that he actually does
       care about fighting tyranny.

       Unlikely he will shift blame in any specific way. That would be
       terrible for his career. You don’t want to be known as the
       screenwriter who burns their director, actors, ect. on twitter and
       youtube every time one of your scripts doesn’t do so hot in the box
       office. No one will want to work with you.
       If he’s smart he’d use the whole thing as a venue to humanize
       himself. He may even mea culpa and just say yeah I was feeling
       vulnerable and made some dumb tweets while crying into my shot
       glass. Everyone has bad days. etc.
       If he is appearing on BotW I doubt it will be to have a
       confrontational derisive debate over the merits of his work. I’ve
       yet to see the RLM guys do that with any guest. They took the piss
       out of Samurai Cop and all of Len’s Movies and when they came on
       the guys treated them well and let us meet these human works of art
       on their own terms. Len got to do a show on his favorite movie
       genre and generally surprised us, and I think the gang as well,
       with his affable nature. They could have turned it into an
       uncomfortable interview where they grilled him over every baffling
       incompetent decision he’s ever made as a director, editor, star,
       writer, in his collection of schlock, but they didn’t. They saw Len
       wasn’t really living under any illusions as an auteur. He just had
       a lot of fun making silly movies and trying new shit, so he just
       did that. The RLM guys act like acerbic assholes with their dark

       Anybody remember that bald dickless dentist who lured a lion off a
       game preserve, shot him with an arrow, followed him until it was
       inconvenient, started drinking in the jeep on the way back to his
       bungalow, passed out in his chair with a full pitcher of ice that
       had been airdropped the previous day, then dreamed of killing more
       lions in even cruder fashion, and when he awoke at 9 a.m. had
       breakfast, then went out to track the lion using a gps sniffer,
       then found him, yet was so hung-over he missed the beast’s heart
       twice with his crossbow bolts so a guide had to dispatch the
       suffering animal?

       who was loudly questioning how he could acquire a ticket to see

       a methamphetamine addict even tho he couldnt have been older than

       Inspired by the correlating HitB episode, I decided to watch the

       It’s a great movie to make fun of with a group of friends. Kind of
       in the same vein as Blade. It also has Bane in it, whose nose hole

       Also, this guy does not really know SW all that well. He alluded to
       continuity errors that can be explained a lot by the inclusion of

       fact he didn’t mention this, but complains about the 1997
       re-release edits ‘just because’ makes absolutely no sense.

       In my language “papan” is slang basically meaning “an idiot”.
       Possibly something in relation to hoof (papak – which is also slang
       for uncultured/uncivilized “peasant”, usually also stupid) – which
       would be basically a metaphor for someone with intelligence
       appropriate to hoofed cattle.

       in a panic that I was two and a half hours late to catch the bus to
       work. Hurriedly, I threw on my slacks and tied my necktie and raced
       out of the apartment, only to realize half-way to the bus-stop that
       it was awfully dark for 8:30 in the morning.
       Boy-o, did I feel stupid!

       un-relatable in every way.
       So no. I think Stupidman would beat the Death Star, because of how
       stupidly overpowered he is. He’d just use his laser vision and melt

       I say yes. As a fan of Superman, I very much dislike the

       because of what he represents, not because of how powerful he is.
       He isn’t even in the top 10 (or top 20) most powerful DC character,
       or shouldn’t be, in my opinion.

       And that’s the GOOD part.
       Seriously…
       Pick up Crown of Stars by James Tiptree, Jr. (AKA Alice B.
       Sheldon).
       Among many “happy” stories (which include yummy human babies and
       drugged up soldiers shitting themselves then killing everyone
       around) there a story about a girl trying to fuck the planet. As in
       Earth.
       Plot twist – Earth IS a caring piece of rock.
       But it does not care about the human girl (which it abuses for fun)
       but about another planet.
       Then Earth and that other planet have sex. As in they slam into one
       another.
       That collection is also charming cause it contains the story which
       basically describes author’s plan to kill her husband in his sleep
       and then to die herself while being burned alive.
       Which is completely different from reality where she shot her
       husband while he slept and then shot herself too, some three months
       after writing that story.
       The girl in the story is also a no good, self-centered bitch.

       And since Winston is stupid as shit, it never crosses his mind that
       maybe they torture everyone with rats, or that it was a lucky
       guess, or that they’ve figured it out by watching him while he
       sleeps while rats made noises in the walls OR that BB purposefully

       I didn’t realize the song was a remix, because I came across it in

       This happens quite often with summer songs charts – when you think
       of it, the most “important” trend of the summer is dance music
       thanks to all the festivals and especially Ibiza scene. If you

       I just rewatched Her by Spike Jonze and I have a question:
       Did any of you guys feel the ending was slightly weaker than the
       rest of the movie?
       I mean, the general idea of how to develop Theodore’s character was
       very good, but you could not quite feel the final change and why he
       was capable of escaping the mindset he had towards relationships.
       You could understand why he was capable of that and the movie gave
       you clues, but I didn’t quite feel the ending had much to offer in
       terms of emotional closure.
       P.S. Sorry if I didn’t explain this too well – I haven’t written
       anything in english for quite some time.

       So I heard there is a new TV show that somehow flew a bit under
       radar despite featuring director of The Girl With A Dragon Tattoo

       Call Saul and Fargo this year.
     * Domo
       My memory is hazy because it’s been awhile, but I felt the ending
       worked really well. It was probably the first time in a long while
       where Theodore looked at the world for what it was, without all its
       technological distractions, and became happy with what he saw.
       That’s probably a terribly difficult theme to show visually, but
       Theodore walking around a room with no technology on, then looking
       outside and finally embracing what’s out there by walking to it,
       was a really nice way to display that theme.
     * Domo
       There’s a great website that does pretty in-depth TV reviews, one

       “It’s hardly even groundbreaking! Why can’t he be gay? Why can’t he
       be into boys?”
       Someone needs to tell him that “Spiderman being into boys” carries
       slightly different connotations compared to “Spiderman being into
       guys”.
       Slight difference.
       Another thing is, there is already a character out there that fits
       “into boys” profile (and into girls too) whom Spiderman would have
       to compete with.
       His name is Pedobear. And he’s an Olympic athlete too.

       He is awesome. Kill List and A Field in England are two of the best
       movies I’ve seen in probably the past few years. Disclamior; don’t
       be fooled by the genre visage of period piece/crime movie. These
       are Horror Movies!
     * Mr_Wint_Trans_Strong_Bow
       Exactly; concerning her being a character beyond just token. It can
       be argued that she is equally as important as Luke because
       according to Yoda she is the other hope beyond Luke. And the
       Bechdel Test; what a bunch of BS that is. You could make an
       argument that the Bechdel Test is a presupposition that women MUST
       be included in a movie. What about movie’s like Predator, or
       JarHead. Both awesome movies; not much women interaction. Are we
       going to force that female presence for the sake of PCness over
       actual authenticity? It’s like in the Captain American movie (set
       during WWII) where there are black soldiers fighting. That didn’t
       happen actually during WWII. That’s not racism necessarily, it’s
       historical fact. Can’t wait for Peter Weir to re-release Master and
       Commander where women are digitally entered into scenes for the
       sake of the Bechdel Test.

       Yea, they don’t view gender as anything related to their sexual
       desires or something – hence the difference between pansexuality,
       bisexuality, this comment section and Andrew Garfield.
     * Palpatine
       That’s not a bad idea.
     * Earth
       I understand what the Bechdel Test is trying to accomplish. My
       problem with it is that it just doesn’t work as a means of
       combating sexism. If I was to make a movie with an all-female cast,
       but was using the film to say that women are inferior and should
       get back in the kitchen, I could still pass the Bechdel Test so
       long as two women spoke to each other about something other than
       men in the movie. And as you said, there are plenty of movies that
       aren’t sexist but also don’t have women in them.
       I understand what the Bechdel Test is trying to do, but I hate
       people bringing it up as some kind of critical point to make about
       a movie. I’ll take Leia any day over bland (hot-pants) Padame.

       Exactly. I understand why it’s been implemented as progressiveness
       becomes the norm; but I don’t like how it’s considered a default
       men gauge of whether a movie portrays women fairly. I agree, as a
       young boy watching Star Wars I understood the context that men are
       sort of in the forefront and that women are not necessarily
       involved in the ‘Star Wars’. A normal kid knows this and is
       probably able to relate to Leia fairly without other supplemental
       women characters.

     * Brack to the Future
       Nice Prometheus reference. I simply love the gleam on the teeth of
       the undertaker in Godfather’s opening scene. Like stealing fire
       from Heaven.
       A Titan. And His liver gets eaten daily by a giant eagle.
       (Coppola’s, that is, as he progressed through Fatty Liver.)
     * TapewormBike
       Have you ever seen Old Dogs? That’s a Sandler quality movie.
     * [290]maggit
       M Night didn’t have a multimillion dollar franchise he sold off to
       Disney.
     * Wizard Phoenix
       Yes because Bill Cosby is in it.
     * TapewormBike
       I’m sure they are already working on The Village ride.
     * TapewormBike
       Let’s get back to games, because that’s obviously my expertise.
       What is your favourite long running series?
     * Brack to the Future
       Doom. I can’t wait for the reboot.
     * Palpatine
       The Sims series.
     * TapewormBike
       I never even thought about Doom as a franchise, even if it
       obviously is. Doom 1 and 2 are the same game to me and 3 was
       something completely different.
     * Brack to the Future
       Yeah just what they meant at the time: true network mayhem with no
       cover mechanism. Such fun, such pre-ethernet glory!
     * TapewormBike
       Figures, controlling lives of the lesser people is what you’re
       known for.
     * [291]maggit
       I used to love Need For Speed until Underground came along.
       Technically, Hot Pursuit 2 for PC was shit too but it wasn’t the
       worst that could happen to the series. Hot Pursuit 2k10 was kind of
       fun, though.
       Metal Gear is definitely one of my favourites even if I stopped
       playing at 2 because I never bought a console.
       The most recent series needs to be the Souls series. I’m quite
       excited for Dark Souls 3.
       Oh, and on a related note, Capcom is finally releasing Dragon’s
       Dogma: Dark Arisen on PC!
     * TapewormBike
       I’d go with Fallout, but I never played the 3D ones.
     * [292]maggit
       As much as I enjoy Doom, I’m a Quake kid. Quake 2 is probably one
       of my favourite FPSes ever.
     * instant relief
       RollerCoaster Tycoon & SimCity
     * [293]maggit
       OH GOD, YES. I’ve finished Fallout 1 and 2 at least 4 or five
       times. Those games are brilliant.
     * TapewormBike
       I was a dumb kid, played Theme Park.
     * [294]maggit
       I played a modded version of DooM 3 that allowed singleplayer coop.
       It instantly made the game feel more like DooM 2, no more jump
       scares, just action.
     * instant relief
       Well, then you’re in luck, ’cause there are 2 new amusement park
       manager games in development right now.
       But why “dumb kid”? Theme Park was awesome as well.
     * Brack to the Future
       Does Chess count?
       No wait, Age of Empires. I’ll probably play that until I’m too
       stupid to eat sheep.
     * TapewormBike
       In that I was sorta scared of RollerCoaster Tycoon. Theme Hospital
       was brilliant as well.
     * instant relief
       I love Sims 3 & 4.
     * Wizard Phoenix
       Zelda, Doom, Elder Scrolls, Mario, and Halo.
     * TapewormBike
       Ooh, that sounds good.
     * Brack to the Future
       I love old-school SimCity stuff.
     * Wizard Phoenix
       Is this the greatest film scene ever?
       [295]https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2bN62MmT-lw
     * instant relief
       Yeah, Theme Hospital still rocks to this very day. Especially with
       a recent mod that enables HD resolutions.
       But why were you scared? It’s just such a cute & wonderful game. 🙂
       I wasted my youth on that franchise.
     * [296]maggit
       The only good game Bungie ever made was Oni.
     * Wizard Phoenix
       Onitted?
     * TapewormBike
       No MGS? I’d say that based on your comments about the latest
       Sutherland joint.
     * instant relief
       One of my first gaming experiences was Battle Chess on a monochrome
       display. 😀
     * TapewormBike
       Which reminds me, who played Onimusha?
     * Brack to the Future
       That sounds like sklnning Windows 7 to look like XP, if you know
       what I mean!
     * [297]maggit
       You know, I used to love David Hayter’s portrayal of Snake but
       after hearing modern voice acting in games… he’s really stiff and
       cheesy.
     * Wizard Phoenix
       Technically not long running seeing out there is a lot of gaps
       between games but it is one of my favorites. I love the latest game
       as much as I loved my ex Anne. Anne, why did you leave me?!
     * TapewormBike
       No idea, seemed more complicated. A bit later I played a lot of
       Steel Panthers, so, framkly, I don’t have an answer,
     * TapewormBike
       Battle Yess!
     * instant relief
       I wish they would make another one of those, but I know it will
       never happen seeing shooting with puppets was pretty much a
       nightmare.
     * TapewormBike
       I know he is, but what portion of that is, y’know, the dialogue?
     * instant relief
       RCT gave you lots of freedom and I loved it. I remember downloading
       empty maps with endless cash and then building my own parks from
       scratch.
     * Wizard Phoenix
       There isn’t a lot of dialogue. A lot of the character’s actions is
       shown rather than told.
     * RLMkeepitup
       I kinda assumed that was done on purpose since there’s humor
       throughout the game it doesn’t take itself 100% seriously
     * TapewormBike
       I meant in the older games. And in those, I remember being in the
       codec for a LOT of time and cringing too.
     * TapewormBike
       Do you think a love can bloom in the comment section?
     * Wizard Phoenix
       That was acceptable because of the 80’s action vibe. As the games
       went along to MGS4 Hayter was great and not cheesy as Snake.
     * Brack to the Future
       Grand Theft Auto. Remember Raspberry Ripple!? Or mowing down 17
       Elvis impersonators? (I have four faves)
     * Wizard Phoenix
       I don’t like comments. They’re rough and course and it gets
       everywhere.
     * RLMkeepitup
       we used to drive around liberty island mowing cilvians down. they
       would regenerate by the time you did a complete loop

       reason I don’t have a driver’s license in real life.

       Oh man the radio stations. You could drive all night.
     * [299]maggit
       I think you’d fit in playing Carmageddon. Those games were kind of
       groundbreaking back in the day.
     * TapewormBike
       I still need to actually play that somehow someday.
     * Wizard Phoenix
       When I started to play MGS4 Anne called me and said “J, I want to
       see someone else.” And then my next line is screaming.
     * [300]maggit
       Well, with Konami getting out of the console/pc market I think you
       might need to hurry. I hear they’ve been removing stock from store
       shelves in Japan.
     * TapewormBike
       I heard about them fucking up a lot lately.
     * Brack to the Future
       Just be careful. I hear these guys aren’t organic so your love
       might end up with some unapproved pesticides on it.

       What I could never do was Final Fantasy. I tried the BEST EVER,
       seventh one on Playstation and 8 on PC and the random battles

       Guys, I just had a scary thought. You know how before The Phantom

       to be greatest thing ever and then it sucked, well, what if the
       same thing happens with The Force Awakens?
     * [309]maggit
       There’s one way to avoid this, you know. Don’t get excited.

     * Jay Stein
       I watched it one, it was awesome, but NEVER again
     * Palpatine
       You sure about that? I’m mean the film comes out in three months,
       and we no virtually nothing about the plot.
     * Wizard Phoenix
       Well here’s what we do know that well keep people excited but not
       Phantom Menace level excited because that will never happen again:
       1. No George Lucas
       2. No space taxes plot
       3. Ignoring the Prequels
       4. Solid director and writer
       5. Keeping the plot hidden is good
       6. Balance between CG and practical effects
       7. No cartoon rabbit
       8. No little kids in lead roles.
     * instant relief
       I’d buy that for $24.99.
     * instant relief
       Same with rape.
     * Palpatine
       Thanks for that. Now someone make a comment about why I shouldn’t
       be excited for it.

       I love it, as well. Even read the book.

       It’s Star Wars.

     * Jay Stein
       Some of it is sure to be “meh”, but I don’t think it will “suck”.
       I’m pretty sure that it will be like the Trek movies he made,

       I was excited until I really thought about it.
     * Wizard Phoenix
       Okay:
       1. JJ choose the script for Into Darkness
       2. “Part time”
       3. Carrie Fisher is no longer hot
       4. That weird red arm of C-3PO
     * Palpatine
       5. Dumb sounding character names.
       6. Merchandise.
     * Wizard Phoenix
       You’re not Jaws.
     * Palpatine
       But still, the names are pretty weird sounding.
     * Wizard Phoenix
       Not as bad as the prequels’. Nute Gunray.
     * Palpatine
       Then why is Jaws complaining about the names?
     * Wizard Phoenix
       I don’t know. Dexter Jetster.
     * Jay Stein
       Well, you know it’s going to be a good time at the Theater. My
       concern is that the story is always the same, Jedi vs Sith and some
       folks in-between. The story has entered “Space-Opera” zone…
     * Palpatine
       Gloomu Uptu.
     * Jay Stein
       Ohh, the red arm on 3peeOh sounds cool
     * Palpatine
       It always been a space opera.
     * Plan9_of_the_Apes
       Because the trilogy told a satisfying story, and instead of telling
       a completely different one, this apparently is insisting that the
       ending of Jedi, with all the celebration and inter-species
       excitement, wasn’t really the ending you thought and everything
       stayed dark and sad and now we have to re-visit some of the same
       old shit and then continue it.
     * Wizard Phoenix
       Padme Amidala
     * Jay Stein

       on such massive scale till the sequel of the reboot.
     * Plan9_of_the_Apes
       2 questions…
       1. You really think you can get them to stop talking about Star
       Wars?
       2. How did you find that? I guess I mean to ask, Why did you find
       that?
     * Plan9_of_the_Apes
       It’s the internet. People just make stuff up.
     * [315]maggit
       Maybe. Or try thinking being a pessimist. It may save you a lot of
       disappointment, especially when an apprentice who is a whining

       Disney has people that know how to make satisfying movies, might
       not be great movies all the time, but movies everyone is okay with.
       They made an investment of 4 billion, similar to the investments
       they made for Pixar and Marvel. They know what’s the formula to
       make things work.
     * Hank_Henshaw
       Keeping the plot secret is good, except when it comes to JJ Abrams
       (and his former idol Chris Carter). Sometimes the “Mystery Box” is
       just an empty box and there’s nothing inside (Super 8, Lost,
       Cloverfield, STID, Alias, etc.)
     * Hank_Henshaw
       That’s not how progeria works.
     * J.aws F. K.
       honestly, I’m secretly hoping it is a bad movie, but a funny bad
       movie, if it turns out to be a genre defining classic well I’m down
       for that too, but still, I could do with a good laugh, and Captain
       Phasma, baby, please, don’t let me down.
     * Hank_Henshaw
       The Happening was an unintentional horror comedy, except it wasn’t

       Yea, they started out with some punkish sound back in the 90s, went
       through the obligatory phase of nu-metal (although, in their case
       that is hardly specific) and then went on to do some more “mature”
       metal / reggae / rap and so on further in 2000s. They are actually
       still around and recording.

       I imagine most bands of the nu-metal fad are still around,
       hopefully with a different sound. I don’t totally hate nu-metal
       though, Foo Fighters’ third album was sort of a reaction to
       nu-metal and it is one of my favorites (even if they were kinda
       ripping off Dinosaur Jr’s sound), so I gotta thank Limp Biskit,
       k0rn, P.O.D., Papa Roach, etc. for that.
     * tOmy`
       Kinda. The shameful thing is that the nu-metal fad was just that –
       a fad. It is obvious that most of these bands were working on some
       kind of sound revolution, mixing genres and trying to pave some
       path to the future sound of rock and they all failed. Most of them
       spectacularly.
       Could have been great. Maybe.
       It’s like when MCR / Green Daz tried to introduce concept albums to
       kinderpunk and although they succeeded to some kind of degree, it
       very quickly got forgotten and people moved on.

       in that one shot set up the neighborhood, possibly have a little
       girl on a tricycle in one of the driveways, even have some

       So I finally finished first season of Mr. Robot. And before we get
       to 9/11 jokes, here is a little write up of what I think is one of
       the best damn fucking shows of past couple of years (or at least
       one of the most unique):
       So there is an invisible war going on in the world – and the
       revolution is one keystroke away. Or is it?
       We meet a young hacker who is suffering from paranoia,
       schizophrenia, morphine addiction and social anxieties. Or do we?
       Because, as the hacker himself narrates the story for us, we are
       just mere fragment of his imagination… an imaginary friends so he
       doesn’t feel alone. Someone he can talk to. Someone he can trust.
       Or can he?
       And we also meet couple of people from his world – people easily
       definable by their social life on the internet and their bugs and
       their weaknesses. Some of them are insane. Or are they?
       What you are about to witness within the first 10 episodes of this
       new show is very close to mesmerizing, detailed and borderline
       philosophical / psychologial / technological thriller that I don’t
       think we wanted, but now I am sure as fuck we needed. I am not
       gonna spend hours by talking about how incredibly well it is done,
       shot, edited and executed. Nor am I gonna talk about the incredibly
       well handled soundtrack and score. I am just gonna say: This show
       deserves all its praise it is getting, because the feel you gonna
       get from it is unmatched and almost unprecedented.
       Somebody just hacked TV shows and then watched the world burn. And
       it was glorious. (episodes vary from 8/10 to 11/10)

       And a small side-note: The creators already stated that the first
       season was just a mere opening of the real mindfuck craziness to
       come. If they top this (and, from what they say, they will) we are
       in for one hell of a show and a runner for one of the best stuff to

       Toward peace and understanding, here’s a poem from a newspaper
       clipping actually from 1889. It was contemporaneously pasted into a
       book by Robert Browning published in 1872, then given to me by my
       now-ex-wife in 1899.
       A PEARL, A GIRL
       A simple ring, with a single stone,
       To the vulgar eye no stone of price;
       Whisper the right word, that alone –
       Forth starts a sprite, like fire from ice.
       And lo, you are lord (says an Eastern scroll)
       Of heaven and earth, lord whole and sole
       Through the power of a pearl.
       A woman (’tis I this time that say)
       With little the world counts worthy praise;
       Utter the true word–out away
       Escapes her soul: I am wrapt in blaze,
       Creation’s lord, of heaven and earth
       Lord whole and sole–by a minute’s birth–
       Through the love in a girl!

       Considering that a significant portion of humans are either babies
       or no longer sexually capable (ink in the pen dried up long ago,

       On the other hand (HA!) I’d say that 95% of people have, do, or

       I think Fury Road is good, but it has been blown out of proportion
       how good it really is. Ultron was a big disappointment, it was the
       Joss Whedon movie I feared the first Avengers movie was going to
       be. None of these 2 movies were that great, or that bad. Both were
       perfectly acceptable. In a few years no one will remember either
       flick.
       If I had to pick which one is better, I’d go with Fury Road. Age of
       Ultron gets a lot of mileage out of the history the audience now
       has with this cast of actors/characters/superheroes. On the other
       hand, I can’t figure out why they bothered to go with Tom Hardy for
       Mad Max, that could’ve been anyone. The Gibson version of Mad Max
       had a little something more I can’t quite pinpoint what it was.
       Jurassic World was my kind of dumb entertainment this year.

       No Fury Road is as awesome as everyone says. I got the Blu-Ray and
       I’ve watched it 4 times and it just gets better, unlike Prometheus
       and many others.

       I guess I just don’t like Tiny Bane as Mad Max, even if he’s been
       good in other movies.
     * Jay Stein
       Some movies have the uncanny ability to get better upon each
       viewing.
       For me these are some of the movies that just get better:
       Empire Strikes back
       The Warriors
       District 9
       Alien
       Mad Max Fury Road
       Road Warrior
       Outland
       Close Encounters of the Third Kind
       Jaws
       Raiders of the Lost Ark…
       I’m sure there’s more
     * Palpatine
       Can’t argue with any of those.
     * Jay Stein
       I like him better than Mel ultimately but Mel is near perfect in
       the Road Warrior
     * Jay Stein
       Please add to the list..

       Very nice. I especially agree with King Kong

       I probably shouldn’t ask but do you mean the original or Peter

     * Palpatine
       He already said Alien.
     * Wizard Phoenix
       Then Aliens.
     * Jay Stein
       They’re pups…actually no, but they’re younger than me, by a small
       margin
     * Wizard Phoenix
       Aren’t you shocked as well Colin and Jim are older than Mike and
       Jay?
     * Jay Stein
       it’s fucking awesome, it took 12 years to make…and watch

     * Jay Stein
       Jacksons version is ok, except the bestiality aspect. A pretty
       blonde would never fall for a huge ape, even if it saved her life.
       Fay Wray’s take on it was much better ( God she’s gorgeous!)

     * Wizard Phoenix
       “Terminator movies, oh wait they just sucked to begin with” Oh you
       done fuck up now, son.
     * Palpatine
       1933 version, obviously. And yes, The Godfather does take patience
       to watch. But if you’re Italian-American like me, you’re naturally
       drawn to it.
     * Jay Stein
       The computational cloud?
     * Jay Stein
       I should clarify all except the First one, and some of the second
       one
     * Palpatine
       I agree with everyone except the last one.
     * Jay Stein
       I meant the last 3. Not Terminator or Terminator 2
     * Wizard Phoenix
       “Some of the second one” You still done fuck up, son.
     * Palpatine
       I’ll allow it.
     * Like Icare

       Found on reddit: Cue Blood Debts theme.
       [406]https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tHSIsH63c0Y
       Richard Harrison [Mark Collins in Blood Debts], age 45 turned down
       Sergio Leone’s A Fistful of Dollars and recommended Clint Eastwood
       for the role. Harrison joked that was his greatest contribution to
       the cinema. He gave himself up to the authorities after the
       incident. He is now serving a life sentence.

     * Wizard Phoenix
       Joaq’s Road House story:
       When I entered my freshmen year of highschool in my English class
       was this guy named Bowers who sounded like Mister Plinkett. Bowers
       was enragingly stupid on multiple levels. I talked to him and I
       mentioned me being in a small role in a movie. Bowers asked me,
       “That’s nice but have you seen Road House? I love it.” I told him
       that Road House is a bad movie, even though it’s a so bad it’s good
       movie. He denied the truth and said to me, “No, you’re wrong,
       that’s your opinion. Road House is not bad, it’s my favorite
       movie.” He kept mentioning Road House every single that school
       year. I nearly snapped at him and he said to me, “Calm down sir,
       it’s just your opinion. Everyday was the mentioning of Road House,
       Patrick Swayze, “calm down sir” and “that’s just your opinion” all
       in his voice which sounded just like Plinkett.
       The school year ended, I spent the summer working on a movie, then
       I went back to school. In my art class Bowers was there. “What’s
       going on, sir?” he said to me. He mentioned Road House, Patrick
       Swayze, “calm down sir”, and “that’s just your opinion” every
       fucking day again. Then school ended, next year in my economics
       class he was there! THE SAME SHIT ABOUT ROAD HOUSE EVERY FUCKING
       DAY AGAIN! And guess what? It happened again! This time he was in
       first year drama and I helping the drama teacher by teaching all
       those little freshmen how to act. Road house again! EVERY DAY! IT
       DROVE ME MAD! And I am not making this shit up. Somewhere out there
       is some weird ass idiot who loves Road House more than his porn,
       tells everyone to calm down for some reason, and sounds identical
       to Plinkett.
     * Wizard Phoenix
       Look above you.
     * Palpatine
       He reminds me of Peter from Family Guy with his weird Road House
       obsession.
     * RLMkeepitup
       we all knew that one annoying guy in high school and most of us at
       some point took our turn being that guy to someone
     * Wizard Phoenix
       He kinda looked like Liam Neeson if he was balding at age 18.
     * Palpatine
       That’s a weird image.
     * Wizard Phoenix
       A weird, balding Liam Neeson who sounds like Plinkett.
     * Wizard Phoenix
       But he was unique. As I mentioned he looked like a balding,
       Plinkett sounding Liam Neeson.
     * Palpatine
       Wizard’s story reminds me of this kid I knew growing up who was
       obsessed with two things: Star Wars, and video games. Pretty much
       his entire life was centered around those two things, and it was
       annoying.
     * Wizard Phoenix
       “That’s just your opinion”
       -Bowers.
     * Palpatine
       Fuck you Bowers, you balding Liam Neeson looking, Plinkett sounding
       asshole!
     * Wizard Phoenix
       “Calm down, sir.”
       -Bowers
     * Palpatine
       He can take his copy of Road House and shove it up his fat ass.
     * Wizard Phoenix
       Like the directors of Jeff Who Lives At Home?
     * Palpatine
       Yeah, why not.
     * Palpatine

       responded. It’s almost like a real life meeting, but not at all!
     * Noah R.
       I pissed you so hard!
     * J.aws F. K.
       I spent eight years trying to reach him, and then another seven
       trying to keep him locked up because I realized that was living
       behind that boys eyes was purely and simply evil.
     * Palpatine
       Speaking of which, have you been reading my script?
     * J.aws F. K.
       Totally. The ”dead leaves” was a nice touch, even JC didn’t think
       of that.

       movies is weird unless you mean it to be ironic, and, also, yet,
       concurrently, irony brands one as a “hipster” and is therefore,
       forthwith, by decree, uncool with the young peoples.

       islam
       IF YOU ARE MUSLIM READ THIS (you can if you aint too)
       This
       was the expected punishment. Have you seen all those cranes around
       the
       holy temple? Those saudis are insane with their building Frenzy.
       But it
       was foretold by the famous hadith of Gabriel by Prophet Muhammad.
       In
       this hadith, asked to give signs of the end times , Prophet
       Muhammad
       (saws) gave two.
       1-When parents give birth to their masters (no more respect for
       parents)
       2-When
       you see the barefooted destitute, deaf and dumb shepherds of black
       camels compete in the construction of the tallest buildings.
       Commenting on the hadith , Al Qurtubi (1214-1273) said:
       “What
       is meant here is the prediction of a reversal in society whereby
       the
       people of the desert country (the bedouins) will take over the
       conduct
       of affairs and rule every region by force. They will become
       extremely
       rich and their primary concern will be to erect tall building and
       take
       pride in them.
       Also Ibn Hajar (1372-1449):
       It
       was said that “bear-foot and naked,” “deaf and dumb” are their
       attributes by way of hyperbole, showing how coarse they are. That
       is,
       they did not use their hearing or sight in anything concerning
       their
       Religion even though they are of perfectly sound senses. Muhammad’s
       words: “The heads of the people” means the kings of the earth. Abu
       Farwas’ narration names the kings explicitly. What is meant by them
       is
       the people of the desert country, as was made explicit in Sulayman
       al-Taymi’s and other narrations: “Who are the barefoot and naked?”
       He
       answered: “The Bedouin Arabs.”
       Clearly the ascent of
       the corrupt gulf emirates was foretold as a sign of the coming
       hour. You
       have all noticed how those emirs instead of helping their fellow
       men,
       like the refugees, and would rather erect the tallest buildings .
       They
       have allied with the enemies of Islam against muslims and are
       hypocritically naming themselves believers.
       islam
       I remind you the tallest building on earth is the burj khalifa in
       dubai and the third is abraj al bait in mecca
       And just below that…

       adding good music can save your video all together or at least give

       On a side note… How could George make a movie without producing
       toys for it way ahead of the movie itself?
       That smells funny. And I’m not talking about eating a clown
       sandwich.
       Could it be that George realized half way through the production
       that he went too far and that immediate diminishing of effects is
       necessary?

       There are several reasons why people dislike RATM:
       1) Singing.
       2) Morello (their godlike bass player) is a massive
       anti-capitalist, rebel and all-around activist and protester, yet
       he was caught hanging out with people you could consider 1%-ers.
       With a glass of champagne in hand.
       3) They wear red stars that people mistake for communistic symbol
       (it actually is a symbol of Zapatista movement).
       4) Their work is far from “usual” music. The genre itself is pretty
       hard to describe.
     * Plan9_of_the_Apes
       Blame it on the rain.

       Aggressive metal-hop fusion.
     * J.aws F. K.
       yeah, thank you milli vanilli
     * tOmy`
       Yea, I mean… you can pretty much fit them into several categories,
       it is just they sound way too unique.
       They are way too creative for your general nu-metal.
       They are way too metal for hard rock.
       They are way too rap for metal.
       They are way too… RATM. Also there is the question whether you can
       consider Zach’s singing… a singing, or whether Morello counts as a
       human being.
     * Jay Stein
       This is an adequate description
     * Palpatine
       I don’t find the genre itself annoying, just the people involved in
       it.
     * Plan9_of_the_Apes
       And, I always got the impression the politics were mostly Zach’s,
       anyway, while Morello was just posing, so “hypocrite” was always
       kind of understood. I’m not surprised, and therefore not upset, by
       any of his personal alliances.
       I kind of gave up on holding my rock stars to their imagined
       principles once I found out Mick Jagger “dug” Maggie Thatcher.
       Now, when-and-if Ian Hunter tells an interviewer he thinks Trump is
       “neat-o,” I may still go ballistic, and I hope Jay Stein won’t
       think I’m being a hypocrite.

       I was just thinking of it today…
       I should re-read it but I’m not sure that there is much to re-read
       once you get to the end.
       It suffers a bit from needing to end… but needing to run longer
       too.
       So the ending feels kinda tacked on after all that filler.
       But there are some interesting ideas there. And it’s an interesting
       update on the whole alien invasion thing. Plus there are some
       actually interesting political elements to it.
       Troubles start when it tries to be topical. It starts getting
       stupid, dated and too… genre.

       I didn’t know those things. Maybe his politics are as sincere as
       the next guy, and it’s just a function of being onstage acting ’em
       out. It’s always tended to look a little stagey, if not outright
       ridiculous. But, I’m hard on my songwriters in general because I
       still confuse writing as one of the more intimate and personal of
       artistic expressions. Once they get up there and do the whole
       “Hello, Cleveland, are you all with me?” shit and the crowd – a
       bunch of stoned bozos who can afford $100 tickets and never had a
       hungry day in their lives – roars, the whole thing starts to creep

       Since 9/11 is slowly approaching its European closure, I would like
       to say few things:
       There will always be a time when people will act cruel, horrible
       and when they’ll do their best to hurt others. That is the way of
       the world. That is the way of human beings. Most of us saw the
       incident live and we all remember and we will never forget – we can
       joke, we can laugh – but we will simply never forget the horrors
       and the outcome of one of the worst INSIDE JOBS IN HISTORY,

       Speaking of tragedies, here is a handy guide to infinity stones:
       The Tesseract (the blue Space Stone) allows for interdimensional
       space travel. It popped up in Captain America: The First Avenger
       and The Avengers,where Loki used it as part of his master plan.
       It’s currently stored in Odin’s treasure room on Asgard.
       The Aether (the red Reality Stone) is introduced in Thor: The Dark
       World and is confusingly not a stone but a swirling magic liquid.
       Some Asgardian warriors deliver it to the Collector (Benicio del
       Toro) for safekeeping in a post-credits scene.
       The Orb (the purple Power Stone) from Guardians Of The Galaxy is
       the one Thanos comes closest to getting his hands on until his
       lackey Ronan (Lee Pace) is defeated by a team of a-holes. It’s
       currently safe in the Nova Corps vault alongside Glenn Close’s
       dignity.
       Loki’s scepter (the yellow Mind Stone) also plays a major role in
       The Avengers. It was a gift from Loki to Thanos (given offscreen
       before the movie begins), who should perhaps be more careful about
       lending out his prized possessions. In Age Of Ultron it gets fused
       onto Vision (Paul Bettany), who is protecting it for now.
       The remaining two Infinity Stones—the Soul Stone and the Time
       Stone—are yet to be accounted for and will presumably pop up in
       some of the upcoming Phase Three films.

       Since you seem to be a big music fan…You may have heard of this guy
       named Prince, formerly The Artist, formerly some weird
       unpronounceable hieroglyph, formerly Prince. Now, I don’t claim to
       be the biggest fan of this guy’s ouerve. (I think that’s French.)
       However, I like it when he plays his guitar and does funky rock n’
       roll. Thing is, this guy’s supposed to be some musical genius, and
       he’s always been very hands-on about his own stuff – you know,
       writes, arranges, plays all the instruments, pretends Wendy-n-Lisa
       had anything to do with it, produces, etc. A real Todd
       Rundgren-sort of obsessive. So, it’s interesting that, after all
       these years – dude’s, like, 80 years old – he’s let somebody else
       produce his latest record. The husband of his latest touring
       drummer, with whom he, reportedly, bonded over Bible studies. And,
       the record is all influenced by the Electronic Dance Music. Bleeps,
       bloops, and auto-tuned all fuckwards. Now, if you recall, Prince
       awkwardly tried to incorporate hip-hop into his thing with
       “Diamonds and Pearls,” which SUCKED. But he refused to stop, and
       then he finally managed a passable modern R&B record with “3121.”
       So, he’s better at setting trends than glomming on to trends, if
       you know what I mean. Do you agree? Anyway, this record, which was
       supposedly recorded in fifteen minutes or something and, hence, is
       called “HITNRUN” is really awful. There are only two-ish
       goodlyesque songs on it, plus a Joni Mitchell pastiches which is
       bearable. You can only get it from Black Empire.com or something,
       which is not how I got it. Well, how do you wrap these things up
       (I’m new around here)?…

       Old anthem had that bit about “curse upon the traitors of the
       homeland”.
       Which is some funny shit cause the country got torn into smaller
       countries, by the guys elected by the people cause they (the
       people) wanted that cool new-old thing from back when
       concentration/death camps were the new hotness and the people
       pushing those ideologies were all best palls with Nazis.
       And then… war, genocide, ethnic cleansing, destruction…
       Almost as if someone put a curse upon people who’d want to tear up
       the country and turn to nationalism.
       Like all those people repeating those words, at every sportsball
       game, at every official event, those words being repeated at the
       start and at the end of the TV and radio program… for nearly half a
       century…

       Lets do an autopsy on Star wars Episode VI: The Force Awakens.
       which is more than a mouthful to say, its not a title its a fucking
       sentence. when The Empire Strikes Back and Return of the Jedi came
       out they did not have episode numbers or even the star wars name,
       and in fact on the promotional material the movie was simply called
       The Empire Strikes Back. Why? because awesome. Because it rocked.
       simple. so lets take off the brand name and the fucking stupid
       episodic numerals, and what ya got left is The Force Awakens,
       staring Captain Phasma and Supreme Leader Snoke….. haha…. got
       that?… Supreme Leader Snoke.. get the fuck out of here with that
       shit. how many people would see that without the Star Wars brand
       name? NOBODY….
       Star Wars the first movie came about because somebody had
       imagination and THEN went to bankroll it via the studio.
       The Empire Strikes Back came about because people LOVED Star Wars.
       it was organic.
       The Force Awakens comes about because somebody bought the BRAND
       NAME and said we need somebody to make a movie.
       Hell even the prequels felt more organic than that ffs.
       is it gonna suck? well lets let Supreme Leader Snoke (LOL) convince
       us otherwise.

       Just because something has money behind it doesn’t mean it’s going
       to suck. Movies are optioned all the time and brands get traded
       around like STDs. Saying a movie is bad because Disney wants to
       make money is something hippies say. “Dude… like… fight the
       establishment, maaaaaan.”
       It is possible for Disney to want to make a shitzillion dollars,
       and for JJ. Abrams and Co. to want to make a good film. These two
       things are not mutually exclusive. The worst thing that could
       possibly be said about The Force Awakens is that it’s “just another
       movie”. And no matter how bad it is, everyone will say “At least
       it’s not as bad as the prequels.” And no matter how good it is,
       everyone will say “Force Awakens is overrated.” So just watch the
       movie. And enjoy it. Or don’t. Either way, fuck off with these
       hipster shenanigans.

       Jar Jar Abrams MAY want to make a good film.
       Unfortunately, he is incapable of making a good film cause (among
       other things) he doesn’t understand that the story is not the
       characters and what they do.
       Nor that you can’t just keep making up stories that run on
       MacGuffins alone.
       Going all the way back to Regarding Henry.
       It’s a series of events, not a story.
       You could change the order of most of the events (most importantly
       the ending) or remove them completely and it would have no effect
       on the movie.
       Sure… some “reveals” ARE in a sequence.
       But the events that are supposedly creating and describing the main
       character and which are supposedly connecting those “reveals” are
       completely arbitrary.
       And yes… that entire movie supposedly runs on a MacGuffin of “Ritz”
       – and even that is not really true.
       You can take out that entire part out of the story – and it would
       end the same way.
       I.e. It wouldn’t. Cause even the ending can be removed or plugged
       elsewhere and it would be the same damn story.
       Story needs cause and effect. Events happening before have effect
       on events happening later.
       It doesn’t have to be told in sequence OR chronologically but there
       has to be cause and effect and it needs to stick.
       Otherwise we get plot holes (effect without cause) and filler
       (cause without effect on later events).
       And not the kind they put in Twinkies… Mmm… kitties…

       The snow glows white on the mountain tonight
       (Snow, white=Ayran.)
       Not a footprint to be seen
       (All records of any foot prints have been destroyed.)
       A kingdom of isolation,
       (The Reich.)
       And it looks like I’m the queen.
       (Goreing?)
       The wind is howling like this swirling storm inside
       (Ice=Meth will do that.)
       Couldn’t keep it in, heaven knows I tried!
       (Lebensraum.)
       Don’t let them in, don’t let them see

       Conceal, don’t feel, don’t let them know
       (Hitlers plans for Russia.)
       Well, now they know!

       Let it go, let it go
       Can’t hold it back anymore
       Let it go, let it go

       I don’t care
       What they’re going to say
       Let the storm rage on,
       The cold never bothered me anyway!
       (Russia)
       It’s funny how some distance
       Makes everything seem small
       And the fears that once controlled me
       Can’t get to me at all!
       It’s time to see what I can do
       To test the limits and break through
       No right, no wrong, no rules for me I’m free!
       Let it go, let it go
       I am one with the wind and sky
       Let it go, let it go
       You’ll never see me cry!
       Here I stand
       (In the Bunker.)
       And here I’ll stay
       Let the storm rage on!
       My power flurries through the air into the ground
       My soul is spiraling in frozen fractals all around
       And one thought crystallizes like an icy blast
       I’m never going back,
       The past is in the past!
       Let it go, let it go
       When I’ll rise like the break of dawn
       Let it go, let it go
       That perfect girl is gone!
       (Goreings suicide?)
       Here I stand
       In the light of day
       Let the storm rage on,
       The cold never bothered me anyway!

       You know, I heard a lot of good stuff this summer – but just by
       simply checking out my most played songs of this summer, there are
       few clear winners:
       Bokka – Town of Strangers

       Shoshin – Same To Me
       [539]https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrAT1lLXuuY
       Honorable mentions:
       For being the most mainstream song ever to be constantly played on
       my laptop:
       One Republic – Counting Stars
       [540]https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hT_nvWreIhg
       That one song that apparently peeked my love for Sonic Youth yet
       again:

       Hey, weirdos. So I found this neat video by TotalBuiscit that is
       about game critics, fans and the disconnect between them – he
       quotes from articles, makes valid points and even draws comparisons
       to movies (Transformers and trailers containing spoilers). While
       this is primarily focused on mixed feelings about Mad Max reviews
       and metascores, he really talks about a lot of other stuff
       concerning criticism, brands, expectations, people knowing what
       they want / not knowing what they want and differences between end
       user and a reviewer.
       I wouldn’t bother you with it if it wasn’t very interesting,
       informative and if there wasn’t Sunday knocking on your doors and
       you had something else than jackshit to do. Worth all 40 minutes, I
       think you will find a lot of insights / opinions about a lot of
       stuff we talk about here, whether it’s movies or games.
       [599]https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJANS0VTpbY
     * tOmy`
       Oh, and it also set to 1080p gameplay of Mad Max, that is also
       worth it.

       And thus the Mad Max hit the intended 70+ demography.
     * [600]Boss Nass
       This seems cool. No vibrating parrot, no yelling, no memes. It’s
       cool. When it comes to ‘500dB ADHD youtube videos’ I am a

       Excluding Rich Evans, our God savior and king!
     * tOmy`
       TB is pretty much the only person I am capable of listening when he
       is talking about games. He is smart, knows his shit, can be very
       funny when needed and he doesn’t force opinions.
       It may be just my personal taste, I know, but I really value his
       input as it seems he is sorta “above” it all – in a manner that it
       seems like he sees product / games from much wider perspective.
     * [601]Boss Nass
       Oh yeah. 3min 15 secs in he’s talking technical mumbojumbo and he
       has already explained why this clip exists and why I should listen.

       I like that about Jim actually. I used to hate all game reviewers
       because they’re so obnoxious and dumb, but it was when I went
       through some of Jim’s stuff and found him talking about the option
       of being transgender in Saints Row 4 that I started to really like
       him because I realized that the ego thing was just a joke to piss
       off the kind of people who take this kind of shit too seriously,
       and his actual opinions come from a more positive place than a lot
       of negative reviewers. Jim seems like he actually wants things to
       be better, and isn’t just cashing in on hating everything.

       yeah but we dont know where they are going with the idea yet.
       If Jedi powers come from Midichloine its a drug that can be
       harvested and injected into anyone. same goes for a genetic ability
       with the force.
       basically the only way to make it fun for everyone is to make it a
       training thing like Zen Buddhism. then if you cant do it its your

       I always thought you can kind of meditate (take space LSD?) to

       I think it was meant to be hereditary and / or something you can
       learn only from other Jedi master; yet you had to have at least
       some predisposition or gift.
       In Thrawn trilogy, Luke actually teaches Leia some basic tricks /
       powers, yet she is aware she will never be a fully “developed” Jedi
       Knight – that is something in store for her children as they will
       be taught from early on.
       Then again, Mara Jade learns a trick or two during her time serving
       under Emperor, but I don’t recall if she has any special
       background.
       I actually believe that most of the EU characters inherited their
       powers.

       A Force-sensitive, also known as a Forceful, was a being who was
       highly attuned to the flow ofthe Force. Force-sensitives could,
       with training, learn to sense and manipulate the Force.
       The terms Force-user and Force-sensitive were distinct in meaning.
       Force-sensitive denoted anyone with Force power, latent or active,
       while being called a Force-user implied that the individual had at
       least some understanding and control of their abilities and was
       able to use them to accomplish specific tasks. The latter was also
       used in a more specific sense as a general term for Force-trained
       individuals who did not belong to either of the two major Force
       traditions

       when he says ”you have it too” its kinda like well i guess i dont

       nobody put any thought into it.
     * tOmy`
       I actually think it was the best line of the trailer as it almost
       seems like Luke is addressing the audience.

       I thought petrol and chrome were the only life you had? ARE YOU
       implying that the Mad Max movies are not portraying Aussie life
       correctly?! YOU RACIST!
     * tOmy`
       I think it does.
       When you think of it, Luke was born with it but he didn’t even
       know. It took 3 movies to get to the point of being an actual Jedi.
       He had to first believe in the Force and understand sacrifice. Then
       he had to believe in himself and face himself. And at the end of
       the OT, he had to face his family, temptation, fear, anger… and
       only after he conquered this 12 step program he was a true Jedi.
       It ain’t just about the lightsaber. So saying “You have it too” is
       actually correct in my opinion. In real life, you have it too to
       become a Shaolin monk. But it does require training of inner self.

       ”’buuttt… you still have to do all this shit too” 😛
     * tOmy`
       Yea, I kinda see your point, but then again: This was a trailer.
       This was marketing. We gonna have to wait for the final product.
       When an advert tries to sell you a car, they usually say some basic
       shit like: You gonna get laid. Like a lot. We are honest. Look at
       them shapes. Even in pouring rain this car looks like it just got
       out of a gala. Laid. Possibly foursomes. Oh, yea, and AC kinda
       works.
       But only after you buy the car you will encounter the manual which
       clearly states that cum stains on your seats will be a bitch to
       clean and people in cars die because of pouring rain.

       Speaking of gay stuff: There is a new Star Wars book by Chuck
       Wendig that features a gay character. Unsurprisingly, someone had a
       very strong opinion against such abysmal idea. Here is the response
       of the author:
       “And if you’re upset because I put gay characters and a gay
       protagonist in the book, I got nothing for you. Sorry, you
       squawking saurian — meteor’s coming. And it’s a fabulously gay Nyan
       Cat meteor with a rainbow trailing behind it and your mode of
       thought will be extinct. You’re not the Rebel Alliance. You’re not
       the good guys. You’re the fucking Empire, man. You’re the shitty,
       oppressive, totalitarian Empire. If you can imagine a world where
       Luke Skywalker would be irritated that there were gay people around
       him, you completely missed the point of Star Wars. It’s like trying
       to picture Jesus kicking lepers in the throat instead of curing
       them. Stop being the Empire. Join the Rebel Alliance. We have love
       and inclusion and great music and cute droids.”

       Yeah, they basically get free PR. The ‘ironic’ thing nobody talks
       about is that most Street Fighter characters are walking
       stereotypes. Each represents some kind of cliche or at least wears
       some clothes that can be loosely associated with their country of
       origin. Zangief needs to have USSR symbols, Chun Li, a female cop
       wears semi-traditional clothing that would prevent her from doing
       her job. Cammy wears a really revealing swimsuit for some reason,
       Poison is a transgender woman who dresses like one of the village
       people, Bison is basically Hitler on steroids. You get the point.

       Neat response from the author however “diversity for diversity’s

       pandering to a special crowd. Anybody remembers that clip of JJ

       remotely not PC the tumblr dwelling comic con crowd would have

       It’s truly fascinating in so many ways.
       From parallels one could draw with similar dance/gymnastics
       routines in all those “hail our glorious leader” countries – and
       how people in all those cases found all that to be perfectly normal
       and even positive display of patriotism.
       All the way to the idea of commemorating a tragic event with DIRE
       consequences for hundreds of millions of people – with a
       dance/jumping of teenage girls in skimpy outfits. It ain’t La Cueca
       Sola…

       from all the other Star Wars shit being shoveled into the public’s
       face? Hmm… maybe the main character is like this tortured soul who
       has a difficult past and is try – Ah fuck it, I’ll just make him a

     * tOmy`
       Yes. This.
       The sooner we will stop making either positive or negative issue
       out of it, the sooner it won’t be an issue at all.
       And then we can fuck everyone we want in public.

       Basically, if the plot provides some reason for him to be gay. Now,
       we never really need a reason for someone to be straight – we just
       accept this as the norm (don’t shoot the messenger, just sayin’ it
       like it is). If the plot of the book revolves around him trying to
       save Prince Leon (like poetry, really gay poetry), then it’s safe
       to say that it’s not just diversity for diversity’s sake. His
       gayness has a point to the story.

       Right, but varied cast of characters can be just that, without

       a bit blatant, but on the subject of gay stuff, some of my most

       I am not sure how extensive is the coverage over the pond, but
       “pretty sad” unfortunately doesn’t even cut it. It is a mayhem of
       opinions, disinformation, hoaxes, 24/7 coverage and desperate
       attempts to do good in the face of clusterfuck that might
       potentially end up blowing back to our own face.
       The complexity of retardness, logistical nightmare and trying to
       make some sense of it is abnormal. The good some people make is
       beautiful. The comments that majority share is excruciatingly vomit
       inducing. And, quite honestly, it may have only just started.
       On the bright side, Facebook friends cleaning season is in the full

     * Palpatine
       There’s coverage of it, but not 24/7 coverage. However, if Obama
       announces he’ll let refugees into the country, you can bet your
       pom-poms they’ll be 24/7 coverage. CNN will have its usual mixed
       opinions on it, MSNBC will love it, and Fox News will announce that
       America is dead.
     * tOmy`
       Yes. This. It also gonna serve as another perfect political
       platform for your upcoming elections. I really don’t wanna get into
       any detail discussion, but it is quite obvious that number 1
       priority is taking care of ISIS – that is up to military (and,
       refreshingly, kinda up to you, guys) – while the EU needs to penis
       up and come up with proper logistics, transportation and
       infrastructure, because no matter if you love / are scared of
       refugees, Germany closing borders is the first step to even bigger
       mayhem.

       Destroyer – Poison Seasons
       You know, for someone called “Destroyer” one would expect at least
       some kind of a soundwave ripping your headphones apart. But this
       baroque pop / chamber pop album is pretty much the exact opposite –
       once the Canadian singer unleashes his playful, yet somehow raspy
       voice, the album takes you on a bittersweet journey through fall
       landscapes painted by the classical chamber instruments – sax,
       strings, trumpets, guitars – that can be both very upbeat and
       charmingly slowtempo. I can’t say what would be the perfect setting
       for such music – except filling slots in smarter sitcoms – but it
       is a definitely an album worth listening to if you are into more
       grown-up music. Check out the key song Times Square – it is worth

       Beach House – Depression Cherry
       American dream pop duo goes back to simple arrangements, simple
       tunes, simple style – and with all that, they can still achieve
       what dream pop has to: Either serve as a perfect late night
       soundtrack or straight up to-sleep-to atmospheric piece. The
       simplicity is possibly the biggest driving point here – the slow
       vibe softly whispers in echoes, calms you and ultimately becomes
       almost mantric. A perfect album to showcase that with less you can
       still achieve a lot. 7/10

       I understand what you mean, but western might be a tad wrong.
       Balkans has this thing that it has always been on the edge of some
       empire or other.
       Multiply that by some 5000 years of history for former Yugoslavia.
       So it is western, but also eastern, northern and southern – and it
       all mixes so much that you’d think there’s no chance for
       xenophobia… except it’s the exact opposite.
       When you have an excuse to rob and pillage non-people on the other
       side of the river – hey, what can be better than that, am I right?
       And when you’re just a generation or two away from such a tribal
       way of life, there will be grudges for what THEY did to US – your
       grandpa or your uncle told you about it.
       He remembers it all, how “they” killed his dad, stole his cow,
       burned “our” village…
       He will neglect to mention (or wont remember cause he was just a
       kid) what “we” did first to “them” for what they did to us a year
       before… Or that “them” is actually “us” as well.
       Add to that the fact that borders were really shifting around these
       parts hundred years ago (empires and kingdoms disappearing like
       crazy) and you get a LOT of opportunity to start nursing a grudge.
       Though you probably already have a couple of hundred years of
       hatred to keep you warm during the long winter nights.
       And for things to get bizarre.
       Like that time during WWI, when Serbian soldiers surrounded a group
       of Austrians and demanded surrender.
       “Surrender, Krauts!”
       “We ain’t Krauts, but Serbs from Lika. And a Serb NEVER SURRENDERS
       WHILE ALIVE! You ain’t passing while we’re here!”
       Or that more recent case where two brothers, both Roma, ended up on
       different sides.
       Now one is a Serb, the other considers himself a Muslim/Bosniak
       (which is its own can of worms) and they can’t stand each other and
       they curse each others whore mothers – with appropriate ethnic
       label.
       Or that recent case of an ethnic Bosniak/Muslim arrested for
       inciting hatred – for putting up posters glorifying a Serbian
       general, currently on trial for genocide, on the eve of the 20th
       anniversary of Srebrenica massacre, committed under the command of
       said general.
       Dude considers himself a Muslim, AND AT THE SAME TIME idolizes the
       guy who 20 years ago was exterminating Muslims around the area
       where he lives.

       The core story could actually be made into a REALLY fun movie.
       Once someone could found the strength to slog through all those
       pages of that Hubbardian Mary Sue epic.
       And those Aryan undertones might be rather too obvious in the
       adaptation.
       Particularly since the real Nazis of the year 3000 don’t appear
       until some 500 pages in, and it doesn’t help that all main
       characters up to that point are uber-white blonds or Scots.
       And then those Nazis team up with cannibals from Zimbabwe, whose
       ancestors were mercenaries and surviving local tribes.

       Important question: Do you think there is such a thing as “so bad
       it’s good” in music? Any ideas?
       My only contender is Duran Duran’s 2007 comeback album Red Carpet
       Massacre that sees the band tackling modern MTV production and it
       is glorious. If you wanna know what am I talking about, here is one
       of the tracks featuring Timbaland (I shit you not):
       [707]https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p4ekceOmscA (for the rap
       break, head to 1:05)

     * tOmy`
       This is superb! I need this. However, it ain’t official release.
       Oh, and speaking of Elton John, he did featuring on Fall Out Boy’s
       closing track “Save Rock’n’Roll” that would absolutely fit the
       category if it wasn’t for the fact that Fall Out Boy are
       purposefully making “joke” music:
       [709]https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SS3E5B75mco
       (I love the idea of including that rapish scratching at the start
       and over-the-top drums.)
     * TapewormBike
       Most of Nu-Metal?
     * tOmy`
       That is hard to disagree with. The thing is that most of the big
       names never exactly failed and when they did (I am looking at you,
       Linkin Park) it was almost unbearable to listen to. (Which I guess
       is the problem with music when it comes to “so bad it’s good”).
       Then again, there is Limp Bizkit’s Chocolate Starfish and Hot Dog
       Flavored Water and that is one clusterfuck for the books. It’s
       mesmerizingly baffling to the point of hilariously good.
       Considering the album even starts with “This is not a test / This
       is reality / Wolrdwide”… yea, you might be onto something.

       Not one that I’ve seen.
       Invaders come, gas everyone, thousand years later one (oh SO
       exceptional) human is given access to invader technology and
       knowledge and is ordered to assemble a team of Scottish miners and
       dig gold for the invaders in a scheme to defraud the main office
       back at invader home planet.
       He uses that opportunity to launch a retaliatory attack on invader
       planet and take back the Earth for humanity.
       They succeed, but now it’s a race against time to unite remnants of
       humanity, re-learn lost knowledge of ancient 20th century humans
       and figure out secrets of invader technology and science – cause
       the second invasion is inevitable.
       Nazis of the future, cannibals, more scams for gold, treachery and
       stupidity against loyalty and brains…
       Then EVERYONE in the galaxy shows up.
       Then there is a war with several alien races at the same time, one
       of them a super-dense race of lizards from Sirius, Alamo meets
       Helm’s Deep…
       Then the negotiations start and while it is still a bit
       heavy-handed Lucas could learn a LOT from Hubbard.
       Particularly cause the whole thing gets resolved at the negotiating
       table – with bankers and lawyers. FROM SPACE!
       Hubbard wrote an epic.
       There is no denying that. And it is an epic story.
       Problem is that while he COULD come up with interesting bits and
       twists – dude was a bad writer surrounded at that point with
       nothing but “Yes-men”.
       [728]http://www.lermanet.com/cos/MissionEarth.htm
       Besides not being particularly good at writing, or sane, he
       literally trained himself to write paid-by-the-word pulp.
       Harlan Ellison talks about that.
       [729]https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9AGVARpqdk
       And that shows in the text… and then things start kinda floating
       towards the surface… and there are racist undertones and
       conspiracies (of various kinds) and “gold standard” logic and
       blowing things out of proportion in a way that Lucas could just
       watch in awe.
       And very much in a “million seems kinda small… let’s make it 100
       billion” kinda way.
       But at the same time… it is a very rare kind of SF where big
       answers are “Math!” and “It’s the economy, stupid.”
       And it’s a pulpy space opera with a LOT of action, adventure and
       creative problem solving. Much of which is ridiculous – but it
       works in that particular environment.
       There IS a fun story in there. But it will never be made.
       Unless it gets some Atlas Shrugged-like adaptation by the faithful
       for the faithful.
       Which is Wheel of the Worst material.

       There are several unused voice files, none of which indicate rape.

       And even those negative lines are more likely to be coming from a
       scenario where player would find a recording of the whole process
       of Caroline being unwillingly into GLaDOS.
       Which probably got scrapped on account of Whitley taking over the
       role intended for Cave Johnson… and cause GLaDOS still needs to be
       a bitch for the ending to work.

       It’s all those smart-watches.[1][2]
       The sudden increase in the number of time observing machines is
       fucking with the observer effect.[1][13]
       Unlike your regular clocks which only display movement of objects
       which REPRESENT the passage of time.
       Those fuckers can keep logs, thus actively OBSERVING passage of
       time and influencing the universe on a quantum level.[2][5]
       They are counting AND noting time.[1][2]
       Only they are all observing their own time, all around the
       planet,[1] but constantly affecting everything else that is
       connected to the internet as it is all just photons and electrons.
       It’s a tiny difference, but when you realize the distances involved
       and the fixed character of the speed of light it adds up.
       So in order for the theory of relativity to work, we are
       experiencing a time-distorting effect as our “corner” of time-space
       is folding trying to match up.[3]
       One of the ways it is obvious that there’s a disturbance in the
       time-space continuum is the extension of January
       effect[3][234][423] to the entire year.

       The album’s concept is based around the lives of the “Killjoys”, a
       group of rebellious rogues living in a post-apocalyptic California,
       in the year 2019 (a reference to the film Blade Runner).
       Promotional websites for the album reference the alleged 2012
       doomsday prediction as a possible cause of the fictional
       catastrophe. Like many concept records, the band members are in
       character, in the case of this album, as their “Killjoy”
       alter-egos: “Party Poison” (Gerard Way), “Jet Star” (Ray Toro),
       “Fun Ghoul” (Frank Iero), and “Kobra Kid” (Mikey Way), which can be
       seen in the music videos for “Na Na Na (Na Na Na Na Na Na Na Na
       Na)” and “Sing”. The Killjoys are a group of outlaws who are
       fighting against the evil corporation Better Living Industries
       (BL/ind.) and its various “Draculoids” and exterminators, such as
       Korse (Grant Morrison), from the S/C/A/R/E/C/R/O/W Unit.

       but if I had to rank them in order I think Half in the bag is my
       favorite.

     * Mr_Wint_Trans_Strong_Bow
       Back in 2009 when I first started watching RLM, I used to browse
       through the comments and think; ‘What a bunch of douchebags’. Now
       I’m one of them……
     * Domo
       I re-watch more HiTBs than anything else. They have so many
       redeeming qualities and are very concise.
     * Palpatine
       An animated CGI remake would work better in my opinion.
     * dollar store cashier wife
       there was a comment section here in 2009?
     * TapewormBike
       Yo momma! Heh. Classic me.
     * [831]maggit
       I used to think recurrent quoting of “it’s so dense…” and “fuck
       you, Rick Berman” was annoying. Now I do that too.
     * Mr_Wint_Trans_Strong_Bow
       I mentioned this last week, but I’ve been on BotW kick.
     * dollar store cashier wife
       I rewatch BOTW/WOTW all the the time instead to pretend I have
       friends and am a perfectly adjusted,happy individual.

     * Palpatine
       I meant content everyone here likes, not content some people like.
     * Mark Bisone
       I sort take of the reverse approach, I think. To me, it’s like
       thinking a person with cancer is terrible. They probably are, but I
       still feel a little bit bad for pointing it out.
     * Domo
       I think I saw your post and went on the BoTW kick, too.
     * Mr_Wint_Trans_Strong_Bow
       RLM comment section has helped me take myself less seriously. In
       all seriousness.
     * [832]maggit
       Yes. This. I also pretend I have a girlfriend but nobody’s seen her
       yet.
     * Like Icare
       Trailer HAD fun.
       The reveal of the narrator was a nice touch.
       And someone probably loved that bit with the whistling bear. I find
       it idiotic but hey… that’s just me.
       Trouble is…
       I don’t see how these things can work in a “serious” movie which
       aims at a “realistic” portrayal of animals.
       That shit works in a cartoon with funny singing animals.
       Where the snake and the tiger are evil but not really scary.
       This… This looks like something that should be PG-13 – staring a
       little kid.
       And to deal with that they will probably make all animals loudmouth
       jokers. Trying to make it all “lighthearted” but also dark and
       dangerous.
       And seriously… Favreau directing? Who signed off on him directing a
       “kids movie” taking place in a jungle?
       Wait… Written by the guy who did such a great job with “Street
       Fighter: The Legend of Chun-Li”?
       Oh… this will be a great episode of Half in the Bag.
     * dollar store cashier wife

       ♫Well, when you go
       Don’t ever think I’ll make you try to stay
       And maybe when you get back
       I’ll be off to find another way
       And after all this time that you still owe
       You’re still a good-for-nothing I don’t know
       So take your gloves and get out
       Better get out
       While you can
       When you go
       Would you even turn to say
       “I don’t love you
       Like I did
       Yesterday”
       Sometimes I cry so hard from pleading
       So sick and tired of all the needless beating
       But baby when they knock you
       Down and out
       Is where you oughta stay
       And after all the blood that you still owe
       Another dollar’s just another blow
       So fix your eyes and get up
       Better get up
       While you can
       Whoa, whoa
       When you go
       Would you even turn to say
       “I don’t love you
       Like I did
       Yesterday”
       Well come on, come on
       When you go
       Would you have the guts to say
       “I don’t love you
       Like I loved you
       Yesterday”
       I don’t love you
       Like I loved you

     * TheManHole
       What I don’t get are people who post on the old old old old
       Plinkett video’s demanding he review other movies like you may as
       well write your suggestion put it in a bottle and throw it in the
       ocean, it’s just as likely to happen.
     * Palpatine
       It was, but Pre-Rec isn’t the most well liked show on here, now is
       it?
     * Earth
       I knew what the live action CGI would look like without even
       looking at the video. Dark, but more tiresomely bland and
       uninspired. A story like The Jungle Book should really be animated
       like the Princess Kaguya movie or Song of the Sea. Something with a
       really amazing visual style. Henri Rousseau’s painting would be a
       great starting point.

       It is filler I think even RLM admits that is designed to be filler
       to fill the gaps in the down time.
     * dollar store cashier wife
       do tell us how it was. I remember discovering RLM in 2011 and the
       comment section being just really dull(and empty too-no more then
       100 comments on anything that isn’t a plinkett review)
     * Palpatine
       It gives me something to do with my boring suburban life.
     * [841]maggit

       Yes. This.

     * Palpatine
       Speaking as someone who isn’t a gamer, I can understand why someone
       wouldn’t like Pre-Rec. Rich and Jack’s opinions on video games due
       tend to be very hipster if you know what I mean.

       You know, I think I discovered the perfect response to that one at
       a party a couple of weeks ago. This person started babbling to me
       about “privilege” this and “problematic” that. At one point I very
       smoothly and calmly interrupted her and said: “Go fuck yourself.”
       “Excuse me?”
       “You go fuck yourself,” I explained again.
       And then she ran away in tears and left the party. Eureka!

       This clip is a fight scene from the movie Street Fighter – The
       Legend of Chun Li. Chun Li and Kitana fight in a bathroom, both
       wearing heels.
       The heel scenes have been slowed down. Half way through, Chun Li is
       out of the bathrooom and fighting other bad guys. When she swings
       on the pole and cartwheels, you can see that her heels have
       changed. They are flat so she wouldn’t break her ankle on the
       landing.

       I think they should start reviewing Pre-Rec.
       So meta, much fuck.
     * [846]maggit
       I think they did:
       “Previously played, video game repair shop! We put the GAY in
       gaming” Then they killed Rich and Jack.
     * TheManHole
       Well there was that greeaaaat Vacation remake, a new
       shamalama-ding-dong movie, and video game movie not made by a
       German. So much to choose from!
     * tOmy`
       The biggest twist of the new Shamalame movie is that it is actually
       receiving good reviews (or so I heard).
     * [847]maggit
       Another twist is that he intended the movie’s tone to be serious.
     * tOmy`
       So no lawn-mower suicides? Damn.

       The trick is to speak to them like you’re speaking to a dog.

     * TheManHole
       I mean I love Jesus but I could never eat a whole one.
     * Palpatine
       Maybe that’s a sign that Pre-Rec will be cancelled soon.
     * [848]maggit
       In all seriousness, though. Their streams have tons of subscribers.
       They’re capitalist hacks, so as long as the money keeps coming,
       they’ll keep on making it.

     * TheManHole
       What sell outs! I mean I love how they dedicate their time and
       effort into entertaining me but why do they need to get rewarded
       for it?
     * [849]maggit
       I know, right?
     * dollar store cashier wife
       Pretty much. It’s not like it was ever intented for an actual
       audience. They spout their oh so valuable opinions in a complete
       vacuum.
     * Mark Bisone
       Is this true, though? Christopher Orr (who has written some of the
       most entertaining reviews of Shalama’s work to date) seemed to
       indicate otherwise. Or at least partially otherwise – he claims it
       was an intentional horror-comedy that was hit-and-miss in both
       departments.
     * Like Icare
       Scarlett Johansson’s voice?
       Oh… I just had a vision of a voice acting Andy Serkis doing all the
       “voice capture” for all the voices which is then filtered into male
       and female appropriate characters.
     * [850]maggit
       Nah, I actually heard that too, but wouldn’t it be funny?

       I honestly don’t have a single bad word to say about the game. The

       (there are some parks that are basically sandbox / you can cheat,
       but still…) and possibly easy, medium and hard option for park
       objectives.
       Other than that (really minor issues), I think this is as perfect

       Are you going to islands of adventure also, or just USO?
       Think of USO like a giant studio tour. Instead of outside rides,
       most everything is in big studio buildings. Everyone will probably
       be over at the Harry Potter attractions, but the rides aren’t bad.
       It’s more ride simulators than roller coasters, and each attraction
       has a fun theme to go with it.
       All the themed restaurants and stores are outside the 2 parks,
       including nightclubs and movie theater. You’ll park, and pass
       through the CityWalk area before going to the parks.

       I plan to go to both. I’m not a big ride person, but the rides are
       based on movies I like.
     * Domo
       Ahh. There’s a Harry Potter train in the back that connects the 2
       parks, which is a ride in and of itself. They did the Harry Potter
       stuff really well, even if you don’t like the series. Little kids
       buy these wands, which when waved a certain way throughout the
       park, cause things to happen (An example being you can make it rain
       on people if they stand under a certain spot.)
       I’m a roller coaster junkie, so I prefer Islands, but it’s still
       worth going, especially the Simpsons park.

     * Hank_Henshaw
       Last time I went, Back to the Future still had a ride.
       Personally, while the Universal Studios parks are great, the Disney
       Parks are better because they put more attention to detail and
       general theming. That Jurassic Park ride, the drop is super fun,
       but the animatronics are lacking. I understand that most of the
       animatronics are exposed to the elements 24/7, 365 days a year, so
       they must sacrifice movement and speed with sturdiness, but even
       the raptors and the t-rex (which are safely indoors) are
       lackluster. Disney’s animatronics are the shit.

       Speaking of games: You might have heard that this is happening:
       [877]https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kznek1uNVsg
       Let’s use a fan quote to establish the importance:
       “I even have Kadaj hair and my face looks Final Fantasy, people
       told me I look like Sephiroth and I am so glad about it, but people
       think i’m a girl because of my hair and face, but I don’t mind
       because… Embrace your Dreams, and, whatever happens, protect your
       honor… AS SOLDIERRRR!!!!!!!!”
     * Like Icare
       They’re renaming it to “REMAKE”? Brave move.
     * tOmy`
       Yea, that “WHAM” noise followed by a word REMAKE is odd as fuck.
       I think all movies should use this by default from now on.
     * Bubs
       No matter how good it is, it’ll suck compared to the original. No
       matter how bad it is, people will buy it by the truckload, because
       “I’ve heard of that”.
       Pretty much everyone who has ever played FF7 has wanted a graphical
       update to the game. Read that again: GRAPHICAL UPDATE. Not a
       REMAKE. To put that in movie terms, you can remaster Citizen Kane.
       You can make the picture clearer and the sound better. But who in
       their fucking right mind would try to remake it? It’s the
       definition of lightning in a bottle.
     * tOmy`
       Frankly, I am not even sure what are they doing. I heard it’s an HD
       remake and the fight system might change. That’s all I know. Then
       again: BIG SWORDZ. BIG FUCKING SWORDZ.
       Damn, now I want to watch Advent Children:

       WHAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAM.
     * Bubs
       They want to change a lot of things about it. Which is a reboot.
       Think Nolan’s Batman compared to Burton’s.
       I mean, just watching the trailer, even the music isn’t the same.
       I’m sure they’ll get Nobuo Uematsu to do the soundtrack, so it’ll
       be a symphonic masterpiece no matter what, but the music was part
       of the magic of VII. Even tiny differences can begin to chip away
       at that loveable original veneer.
       And yeah… I’ll probably buy it to, because I’m a shmuck and like an
       abused housewife I keep thinking “Maybe this time Square will be
       different”. If it sucks, I’ll just go back and play the original
       again.

       I watched X-Men: Days of Future Past and Eyes Wide Shut last night.
       Needless to say, it was an awesome night! I always take Mike and
       Jay’s word; Days of Future Past was so good. I wanted to see more
       scenes with Quicksilver; that was just a big tease though. Going to
       have to wait for Apocalypse.
       Eyes Wide Shut; seriously one of my favorite movies (top ten). The
       whole dream within a dream concept and the use of sets, and weird
       focus on monetary exchange for aberrant sexual practices. Only
       detractor is the Sydney Pollock scene where he pulls a Ed Harris
       from Truman Show. Other than that, it’s awesome. Watch if you
       haven’t.
     * tOmy`
       Agreed on both fronts. Future Pants were really a bit of a shock to

       played
       Final Fantasy 7.
       “The memory of the star that threatened all burns eternal in our
       hearts.” = The memories of Final Fantasy 7 remained forever.
       “In its wake came an age of silence.” = After FF7, years passed
       with no
       news.
       “Yet with each fond remembrance, we knew those encountered were not
       forgotten, that some day we would see them again.” = Fans yearned
       for
       remakes/sequels.
       “Perhaps it was no more than wishful thinking.” = perhaps those
       remakes/sequels would never arrive.
       “But after the long calm, there are now the beginnings of a stir.”
       =
       People were starting to have strong rumors about it…
       “The reunion at hand may bring joy, it may bring fear, but let us
       embrace whatever it brings.” = fans may rejoice that a remake will
       be
       made, or they may fear it wouldn’t be up to their expectations. But
       they
       are going to make it, anyway.
       “For they are coming back. At last the promise has been made.” =
       They
       are bringing the chars back. They finally confirm/promise that they
       will.

       I was hooked right off the bat – the exposition was fast,
       understandable and when you take the concept of the time travel for
       granted, you are good to go. The first fight against sentinels was
       pretty clever – you saw how they adapt and why are they so
       powerful, that whole portal power was used in a great way; I had to
       stop the fight twice to actually see what in the name of a fuck
       just happened and fully appreciate how brilliant it was.
       And from there on the movie was just great rollercoaster ride of
       great ideas and neat ending without any actual over the top action.

       – Clicking on a balloon makes the balloon pop. Clicking on a duck
       makes the duck quack.
       – Security guards are the only personnel walking slower than other
       employees. They also have their cap backwards and walk with their
       hands locked behind their back.
       – Unlike other food, consuming fries does make guests more thirsty.
       – When you open a guest’s window and keep watching him for a longer
       period of time, he starts saying: “I have the strangest feeling
       someone is watching me!”.
       – Murdering guests is optional.

       If I remember correctly, Talon Karrde is the only person in the

       the only one to notice that a big number of ships is already gone.
       He also keeps that information to himself till the climax, because
       he loves tension and drama.
       To be fair: If Karrde was in the Prequels, he would shoot Nute
       Gunrey right into the nutes within first 5 minutes, arrest
       Palpatine within the first hour and by the title scroll he would be

       No, seriously. There is no beating Thrawn as the “evil” character,
       nor there is beating the space battles in that trilogy.

       To some extent yes. The thing with Thrawn trilogy is that it was
       considered SW 7, 8 and 9. And for better or worse, it was more than
       acceptable.
       But instead of bad-ass, well educated admiral with actual tactics
       and understanding, we gonna get some schlocky admiral I’m The Bad
       Guy. I know there is no place for actual cleverness of evil guys in
       SW movie universe, but the more I think about it, the more I doubt
       the movies will get close to it.

       I certainly had much more emotional connection with the characters

       I guess the issue was the studio didn’t have an extremely

       not saying that there is no better way, as in, actually fucking
       making the world lively and part of the story rather than a
       backdrop for action scenes. Which gets us back to why the third one

       No.
       But LotR movies are just an abysmally bad adaptation of the books
       which is excused with “Well everyone loved them” and “Well books
       are boring”.
       But while the first movie is still somewhat OK, main changes being
       pointless inclusion of Liv Tyler (and boy was that a bad casting
       decision) and a general pussyification of everyone but Gimli (who
       is instead made into a joke) and Legolas, and yeah… Agent Elrond
       the Men-hater – third movie is a proof of Jackson suffering from
       the Lucas Syndrome.
       He keeps trying to “make it better” by adding shit to an already
       FAR better written story than he can ever scratch out.
       So we get completely ruined Faramir, Eowyn is a joke, major points
       which are there as thematic and symbolic are ignored and replaced
       with deus ex machina crap…
       The entire third book is supposed to be an ode to the greatness of
       human race – as compared to other races.
       It is supposed to be the source of future songs – the way elves and
       the men of old are at the beginning.
       It is supposed to be a rebirth of old glory of humans DESPITE the
       loss of magic from the old days.
       Because it is not the elven-like agelessness and strength or magic
       but human spirit and rejection of magic and old ways that wins the
       day.
       So, instead of Aragorn bringing the army of ghosts (on ships…
       because ghosts can’t swim I guess) and then having that moment of
       “maybe we should keep them” – book has them bringing an army of
       freed slaves and prisoners (hence – ships) who now fight as free
       men.
       Eowyn in the movie is a one-liner on two legs. “I am no man.”
       In the book there is a whole back and forth where she takes
       Nazgul’s warning turns it around and flings it back at him.
       ‘Begone foul dwimmerlaik, lord of carrion! Leave the dead in
       peace!’
       A cold voice answered: ‘Come not between the Nazgûl and his prey!
       Or he will not slay thee in thy turn. He will bear thee away to the
       houses of lamentation, beyond all darkness, where thy flesh shall
       be
       devoured, and thy shriveled mind be left naked to the Lidless Eye.’
       A sword rang as it was drawn. ‘Do what you will; but I will hinder
       it, if I may.’
       ‘Hinder me? Thou fool. No living man may hinder me!’
       Then Merry heard of all sounds in that hour the strangest. It
       seemed
       that Dernhelm laughed, and the clear voice was like the ring of
       steel. ‘But no living man am I! You look upon a woman. Éowyn I am,
       Éomund’s daughter. You stand between me and my lord and kin.
       Begone, if you be not deathless! For living or dark undead, I will
       smite you if you touch him.’
       And that extends throughout the entire movie.
       Carefully constructed themes and characters are replaced by
       cardboard cutouts and hammy acting.
       All it lacks is its own Jar Jar.

       I think the way YouTube comments via Google+ currently works is if
       you copy/paste something into the comment, it’ll automatically mark
       it as spam for some dumb reason.

       Did you know Hawaiians love Spam? It’s like Candadian back bacon to
       those Polynesians. Isn’t that weird? Despite that, though, they’re
       terrific people. I’ve heard the first thing they do for everybody
       coming off a plane is give ’em a lay. I don’t know what they do for
       people coming off boats, but I imagine it’s something pretty cool
       if they’re giving lays to strangers!
       Wait. What? L-E-I?
       Oh, now I feel foolish.
