   Mike and Jay watch the out of nowhere movie 10 Cloverfield Lane and

       Dayum Mike is backpedaling like crazy on Landis previous efforts. A
       retroactive seal of approval for AU and VF. I just hope those
       hollywood connections are worth it.

       How the hell do you think Space Cop 2 is going to be made? Mike
       isn’t pretty enough to do this shit on the casting couch anymore

       Spoilers
       ————-
       I’m pretty sure the ending scenes for Cloverfield are what tied it
       in with the previous movie. I’m fairly certain the movie wasn’t
       intended to be a part of that franchise in the beginning, but I get
       how they worked it in for marketing or whatever. In the beginning
       they mentioned the power outages across the eastern seaboard, and
       that’s what was going on in NYC in the first Cloverfield movie, and
       basically they just confirmed what the Hell was going on in the
       first one with what was said on the radio in the second. It feels
       like they’re going to keep this universe going, but without tying
       everything together through characters. Essentially it’ll be like
       the World War Z book (and what that piece of shit movie should have
       been) where there’s one big event happening in the world and we
       just get a bunch of individual stories from people that are
       experiencing it at different points in time.

       Max Landis broke Mike. Now he seems to like things…….
     * [69]instant relief
       He jerked him out of the closet.
     * Devil_Dinosaur
       Mike used the novels of Stephen King and the location of Castle
       Rock Maine as an analogy of separate works of fiction that share
       common threads. He could have sited the novels of Balzac for the
       same purpose, if he weren’t a semi-literate, middle-brow hack.

       love you guys, but I don’t know if Mike could dickride Max any
       harder. kinda sad.
     * Adzl33t
       What I like about Cloverfield Land and perhaps Deadpool, is those
       are franchise movies with large settings that are used for smaller
       plots, after many of these bloated blockbusters it’s nice to me to
       see smaller scale genre movies like some of those 80s movies
       Chasing Amy is one of fav movies

     * Patrick Eslinger
       love you guys, but I don’t know if Mike could dickride Max any
       harder. Feels like he’s starstruck be knowing someone famous. it’s
       OK to say Max is a great guy who’s fun to hang out with, but this
       movie blows. We tune in for your editorial opinion, don’t loose
       that because someone famous befriended you.

       So, the next HitB episode is one of the most eagerly awaited of the
       year. It was my most anticipated episode of the year, that is until
       the Ghostbsuters trailer was released.
     * Percy Gryce
       Remember: The boys have gone back in time to the time before Mike
       hated Max Landis’s movies. Mike’s not backtracking. This is an

       For anyone complaing about the Max Landis critical handjob, that

       Someone over at Youtube brought up something that might be a plot
       hole. They are sent back in time, but they are reviewing movies
       from the present. That’s unacceptable. Unsubscribed.
     * Percy Gryce
       That seemingly fatal flaw is easily explained.
     * [76]‘Undercover’ Nass
       I think Mike Stoklasa accepted money from Adam Sandler and Max
       Landis. And Kevin James. And David Spade. And JJ Abrams. And….
       well. All of the people.
     * Palpatine

       True dat. Still if you believe even for a second that Mike started
       backpedaling because he naturally found time/effort/attention span
       to reevaluate the merits of Landis poop you need to rewatch The
       Wire to learn how the streets work IRL…fam.

       Oh, no, I didn’t even watch this episode yet.

       I don’t feel weird about their cutting Max Landis some slack. I
       don’t know him, but I do find myself agreeing with much of what he
       says, and liking most of his work, except for the stuff that I
       really don’t fucking like or agree with. For instance: he said Rey
       in The Force Awakens was a Mary Sue, and that made her a character
       with no stakes, therefore it was impossible to care about her. I
       agree 100%. Then he said Finn was a lame character and that Lando
       Calrissian was much more charismatic, and I cringed. First of all,
       Finn was a great character, and – why are you comparing him to
       Lando, exactly, Max? Because they’re both black? Oh, fuck you. See?
       You like him, then you hate him, then you like him again, then you
       notice his haircut and just feel vaguely nauseous.
     * [83]‘Undercover’ Nass
       You and Mr Stoklasa should get a room……… and watch Landis films =P

       Cool write up, allow me one more comment tho:

       I actually wanted to rewatch it stoned, just to see if the “stoner
       comedy” promotion really could have hurt it, because man oh man,
       that is far from what I would call a comforting movie for stoned
       people.

     * Henrik Larsson
       I think his look works because he is always acting slightly weird.
       He is too adorable not to love.
     * Chomiq
       Ok Max, we get it, you’re gay. No need to make a movie about it.
     * Sully
       I like Max. He’s good people. I’ve been following him on Youtube
       for a while now (probably since his Superman video).
       The thing I find refreshing about him, and maybe it’s because he’s
       a writer too, is he’s not afraid to shit on the industry a bit for
       the way they push writers, or any voice of creativity for that
       matter, to the back of the bus.
       I think that’s why Mike and Jay like him as well. So many people in
       the biz are just total ass kissers, and you do have to be to a
       degree I suppose, but he knows when bullshit is bullshit, and he
       isn’t afraid to call a turd a turd, or a Mary Sue a Mary Sue.
     * [85]‘Undercover’ Nass
       You altered your comment. Is this a Special Edition? Who do you
       think you are, George Lucas?
     * [86]‘Undercover’ Nass
       By they you mean Mike? Because Jay sat there in horror.

       Hi, my name is Max Landis and I’ve been watching this VHS thing
       called Chasing Amy! Well that gave me a great idea! You see I’m a
       hit Hollywood writer and I wanna make my own movie about a guy who
       finds out he’s gay in a wacky fashion! I got an idea weird gotta
       get Haley Joel Osment and we’re gonna have him yell weird pop
       culture dialogue! It’s gonna be like Haley’s Night Out in LA! Then
       the gay guy’s gonna stand 15 feet in on a cliff yelling! We’re
       gonna let people stweam it! And I know them kids like the TORRENTZ
       so I’m gonna bombard every download with solar radiation! I think
       it will create some kind of Manga Tron! And if anyone tries to copy
       a beam is gonna fly right into their eyes like Raiders of The Lost
       Ark! And-hold on. What’s going on?! Get away from my door! Hold on,
       I gotta go yell on Screen Junkies. My name is MAX LANDO! I’m a hit

       The Item has an “urban” chick and an Asian chick (one who fucks the

       Intriguing! Mike sees 10 Cloverfield Lane as a discussion of anal

       It’s always the one you were born into; and that always poses the
       same question: Is that even your generation?
       I think that each country should have its own generations (as many
       of us do, actually) to somehow describe a certain social zeitgeist
       and just forget about the general labels; they are good only for
       saying when you were born. And we already have xx’s for that.
     * Make America Grated Cheese
       Certainly not while the generation is current, but, in hindsight,
       eras can be characterized. That’s what History is. Now, one can
       always argue the accuracy, even of hindsight.
       But, if you believe in “zeitgeist,” then I think you have to
       believe in “generation.”
     * RedLetterMediumsDotCorn
       ohhhhhhh noooooooooooo
     * tOmy`
       The thing with generations is that they are very often connected to
       certain events; mostly American, because fuck the rest of the
       world.
       For example: “The Greatest Generation, also known as the G.I.
       Generation, is the generation that includes the veterans who fought
       in World War II. They were born from around 1900 through 1924,
       coming of age during the Great Depression.”
       Yea… that’s hardly gonna describe 80% of the world.
       Or Gen X: “The term has also been used in different times and
       places for a number of different subcultures or countercultures
       since the 1950s”
       Yea… that’s gonna vary a LOT as well.
       As for Millennials… well, some of our millennials has been born
       under oppressive, violent regime. Something tells me that your
       millennials won’t share that issue with us. (That’s why we have a
       different generation for that).
       Generation is just a time in which we were born. But all of us
       under different circumstances, in different worlds and culture. I
       always laugh at the term “millennials”, because most of the
       millennials here are really far from what I usually see depicted.

       What is the deal with Max Landis? I know he’s been featured on RLM,

       screenwriter. It would be easy for me to say he’s coasting off his
       father’s fame, and to a degree that is inevitable and I can’t fault
       him for that. But is there really a Max Landis following? Has he

       I think AU was a refreshing script; although I can’t really vouch
       for the final quality of the movie, the premise was pretty fun
       (albeit not being as unique as claimed), it had a lot of cool
       moments (mishandled in the final product), some neat ideas Mike and
       Jay didn’t talk about when reviewing, one great memorable moment…
       I ain’t no expert on screenwriting and god knows what Max created
       himself and what was added / cut, but the movie had much bigger
       problems than the script. Sure, it’s not revolutionary, but did it
       have a potential? I would say yes.

       He’ll hit his stride. He should slow down a bit though. I can
       understand burning up the page to get your name out there, but once
       it’s out there, as his is now, it becomes time to start making it
       count.
       He’s mentioned in the past about his ability to blow through
       screenplays faster than most. That breakneck pace is likely why his
       films fall under “Ok, neat.” instead of “Wow! Fucking rad!” His
       closest to great (for me) was Chronicle.
       While he didn’t direct it, his screenplay had good characters, cool
       premise, and a solid arc.

       When talking about Max’s work, I (and a lot of others I saw

       AU was so cool it was borderline “right in your face”. It didn’t
       exactly help.

     * tOmy`
       Wouldn’t say pretentious. It’s far from trying to be smart / being

       Also: I don’t think that when you turn everything to 11, if you can
       somehow come off as “pretentious”. Hey, maybe it is a language
       barrier thing, but for me, only those obscure indie dramas come off
       as pretentious.

       This is why cops and crooks don’t mingle, or critics and their

       can you do? Hopefully, everyone has a bunch of booze together and

       Okay, here are my “great” ideas for Indiana Jones 5:
       Either A.) Make it an animated movie. Have Harrison Ford and all
       the other actors just voice their characters and leave the rest of
       the work to the animators.
       Or B.) Have two actors play Indy. Make the film about an old Indy,
       played by Ford, telling the story of one of his adventures to his
       grandkids, and have flashback Indy be played by Owen Thunderguns or
       someone like that.
       Again, just my suggestions.

       This review probably wasn’t Mike’s strongest, but I did like the
       dynamic Mike and Jay had where Jay casually dismissed the movie for
       its failings and Mike bent over backwards to justify the movie’s
       failings. I sort of take for granted how Jay can sort of be a voice
       of reason for when Mike gets a little too whimsical. He’s probably
       my favorite reviewer on this site, even though everyone in RLM is
       irreplaceable in their own right. (Yes, even Jack, because this

       These trailers haven’t done much for me.
       Some of them have been way, way too revealing of the plot–
       showcasing the villain that Batman and Superman will inevitably
       join up to fight was a very, very bad call.
       This trailer was on the opposite end of the spectrum where it was
       basically just Batman and Superman slamming into each other and
       doesn’t really contain anything tantalizing about the story itself.
       And I guess that’s because the story has already been summarized in
       OTHER trailers but… Fuck, why do their need to be so many trailers?
       In terms of tone, these trailers are all over the place. One of
       them felt like a weird Vaudeville routine, one of them made this
       movie seem like this movie was going to be a dark meditation on
       Batman and Superman’s place in their world, and THIS one makes the
       movie look like it’s going to be an action-packed schlock-fest.
       (Which, really, it would be anyway.)
       It’s like they don’t really know what movie they’re trying to sell
       so they’re just throwing things against a wall and seeing what
       sticks.

       slept-walked through the performance in ‘Return of the Jedi.’ One

       Because he has a knack for compelling storytelling. He’s a
       character writer, but (it seems) he isn’t good at allowing ideas to
       cook. To me it seems that he get’s a spark of plot and character
       and begins writing immediately.
       I have stories like that, but my best shit has been sitting in my
       brain for a few years. My absolute best, a few decades.
       I believe if he slowed down and focused more on quality instead of
       quantity, we’d see a stronger screenwriter/filmmaker. He’s got the
       passion, and that’s damn near enough for me.

       chores yet?”
       “Yes’m,” I’d answer, because I always did my chores first thing
       when my pet rooster crowed, to git ’em outta the way afore school.
       “But, Pops, everbody’s gots the HBO, and they all been watching THE
       GREAT SANTINI, like, everday, on account of that and THE
       BEASTMASTER is pretty much all’s on, but, still, it’s the newest

       “Ah’ll tell ye somethin’ ’bout the newest thing, boy. While ago,
       dem hippies were the newest thing, and look at ’em now that they
       gots that damn-fool Carter in the White House. There ain’t no

       aliens. I liked that it was Cold War Russians instead of standard
       Nazis.
       What killed it was the shit CG sequences, horrid acting, and the
       looming sense that no one in that movie, either behind the camera
       or in front of it, wanted any part of the project. Probably the
       reason for the horrid acting in the first place.

       Mike making the point of “This film might just not be for us” is
       fine by me. Whether or not that’s his affinity for Landis coming
       through is irrelevant to me.
       Years ago, Pitchfork ripped apart “Bleed American” by Jimmy Eat
       World because it was an album for teenagers to listen to. A grown
       up spent 8 paragraphs explaining how an album isn’t for grown ups,
       and talked down to teenagers that might like it. He all but implied
       that teenagers should listen to the same crap that a 34-year-old
       failed lit major listens to.
       When you run every kind of film through the exact same critical
       machine, it can get to the point where you’re not really doing
       anyone a service. And you can sound like an idiot, too.

       What I’m more trying to get at is running a movie like “She’s all

       “The English Patient” or “The Danish Girl.” And how stupid that is.

       Um, maybe. If you want to get technical, no work of art can be
       adjudged on any unassailable standard, since none exists. Every
       critic is attempting a consistent definition of quality, because
       that’s really the only way to make sense of it. The idea — foolish
       as it might actually be — is that there is a Good Art, not a bunch
       of Good Arts, Including The Art That Is Good When You’re 12, And
       All Other Good Arts, Etc.
       By the way, your point is the correct one. It’s just counter to the
       way the critical mind works.
       And, also, doesn’t mean that snobby 34 year-old wasn’t correct

     * Sheriff Mitchell
       He wasn’t, but that’s a discussion for another time.
       Yes, I think “objectivity” is a delusion. But every critic
       attempting consistency is fine by me because it enables an audience
       to identify what a critic’s tastes might be. You can then choose to
       take their opinions with a grain of salt or not.
       I just think it is stupid when someone over the age of 30 reviews
       something that was aimed to appeal to the sensibilities and
       emotions of a teenager, AND reviews it poorly based on that
       criterion alone. “It is stupid because it is for young people” is
       not a quality critique, in my opinion.
       Maybe try to relate, get underneath it. “Did this film/album do a
       good or worthwhile job conveying its message to teenagers?” might
       be a better question to ask as opposed to dismissing it because it
       didn’t cater to the married with forearm tattoos demographic.
     * Sheriff Mitchell
       *By the way, I’m part of that demographic, so I’m allowed to insult
       it.
     * Make America Grated Cheese
       I’ll make one more point…There was a time when plenty of the stuff
       made for teenagers was pretty high-brow stuff. The Beatles, The
       Stones, The Who. Yeah, I know the younglings of today get sick of
       having that stuff shoved in their faces, but deal with it. “You
       Can’t Always Get What You Want” and “My Generation” are the kinds
       of sentiments that taught a certain generation how to deal with
       themselves and with culture. Pretty adult sentiments.
       Those of us who grew up being spoken to as adults, given the
       challenge to act as adults, have a hard time putting up with “My
       milkshake brings all the boys to the yard.”
       The point applies to film, as well.

       Off topic again. I’m in the “rant about music journalists” mood
       today. Though I guess I’m in that mood every day.
       I’m seeing Megadeth tomorrow. One of my favorite bands ever. Out of
       curiosity I read the brief Rolling Stone review of their latest
       album “Dystopia” (which is just excellent, by the way). This is
       from the first paragraph:
       “Is Dave Mustaine running for president? The Megadeth mastermind
       and amateur doomsayer has packed the headbangers’ 15th LP with
       enough fear-mongering to earn him a podium at a GOP debate, as he
       snarls about conspiracies (“The Threat Is Real”), the decline of
       Western civilization (“Lying in State”) and a whole slew of
       hypothetical horrors, calling the world “one spinning disaster” on
       “Post-American World.” It’s pretty grim.”
       Uhh… are you new here? Are you 19 years old? Are you familiar with
       Dave Mustaine’s work at all? This is a guy who – 30 years ago – had
       the charred, burnt, hollowed out remains of the United Nations
       after nuclear holocaust as an album cover. He’s never exactly been
       Mr. Positivity when it comes to his politics.
       I mean, his band’s name is Megadeth.
       That’s all. Thanks for putting up with me, fellas.

       It means “giant puppet penis” where my people come from.
     * Sheriff Mitchell
       I am not, but I do have a quick story. The last time I was in
       Indianapolis I was on tour. My band needed a place to stay. A girl
       at the bar offered us her place, and said she could make room for
       us even though she lived with “other girls.”
       We were thinking “Jackpot.”
       The reality is that she lived in a hoarder house. I went upstairs
       to what would be my room for the night. Covered in ants. My drummer
       later told me that he was smoking in the garage, and saw “help me”
       written on the floor. He asked what that was about. She said her
       husband wrote it there before he left her, and also carved it into
       his leg.
       10 minutes after I got there I heard a needle drop on a record, and
       Blondie started playing. I assumed this was her version of Patrick
       Bateman putting on Huey Lewis & the News, so I gathered the band
       and we got the f*ck out of there.
       All of that is true.
     * Make America Grated Cheese

       I was watching episode 3 of Arrow Season 3 on Netflix and I’m not

     * Sully
       That’s pretty fucking cheap. Oh well. Marvel is killing DC in the
       show department anyway. I can’t even watch Arrow anymore. DareDevil
       and Jessica Jones have spoiled me.
     * Wizard Phoenix
       Flash is still pretty damn good and it’s better than half of
       Marvel’s shows. But those are on fucking ABC and The Flash has
       nothing on the Netflix shows.
     * Sheriff Mitchell
       The real question is why are you watching Arrow Season 3.
       That season broke the show for me once and for all. Because It’s
       the season in which Ra’s al Ghul starts referring to Oliver as
       “Al-Sahim” because the true intent of the show would’ve been too
       obvious if he started calling him “Detective.”
     * Sully
       The Flash is okay. Season 1 was better, imho. DC just doesn’t hold
       a candle. They tend to have better villains, but their heroes are
       just so fucking boring.
     * Wizard Phoenix
       I’m watching it because I love Ra’s al Ghul and so far all I can
       say is WHAT IS WRONG WITH HIS FACE? Seriously he looks like a
       normal guy not an immortal sociopath who believes in a morbid
       twisted view of justice.

       Hey you’ve gone militant auzzie! Who we killing? I’m game.
     * Like Icare
       I paid to watch 1 and 4. Couldn’t ever be bothered to watch through
       2 and 3 even when it played on TV.
       With both 1 and 4, it was “Let’s all go to the movies” thing with
       friends.
       Found the first one to be a childish and soulless moneygrab.
       Wasn’t at all surprised when it grew into a franchise though.
       Cause – a) people have no taste (other than kinda like pork) and
       will enjoy infantile comedy, and b) some parts felt… inspired.
       Like the whole ghost story thing, which kinda felt more… mature.
       And then I read On Stranger Tides by Tim Powers.
       Oh… OH…
       And then I find out that the fourth one will actually BE On
       Stranger Tides and something-something Tim Powers story and by
       golly it actually had the Blackbeard in it and I thought “This one
       might actually be worth watching. Though they’ve already used up
       the best parts of the book in the first movie… still, plenty left.”
       And then the movie started and they mention Juan Ponce de Leon and
       I go “Oh my! This might actually go places!”
       And then Johnny Depp jumps around on a table, and a cake gets stuck
       on thing up there, and then it falls down on someone and…
       And then there’s a scene IN THREE DEEE… where 3D is made out of a
       barrel which is in the front…
       And then the rest of the movie makes you want to gouge your eyes
       out.
       Like when a mermaid spontaneously grows legs. I get the urge to
       headdesk myself as I think about that…

       Hack fraud. The Thing is not depressing, it’s a super fun time with

       can construct a happy ending in your mind if you want to.
     * tOmy`
       I… actually wouldn’t agree.
       Dredd might be dystopic, but doesn’t feature any key aspect of
       cyberpunk – technology (specifically A.I., internet and so on).
       Cyberpunk also features a lot of detective elements, and quite
       often is very nihilistic.
       Can’t say I would really label those movies as proper cyberpunk.

       None of those are cyberpunk.
       Her gets the closest… but the execution bars it from entry as it is
       neither gritty nor is there a feel of a world taken over and run by
       machines to it.
       Dredd is gritty… but lack any focus on technology, it’s again not a
       world run by machines and there’s a distinct lack of meritocratic
       freedom to it. Or any freedom at all.
       Same goes for Looper.
       GITS and the Matrix got it though.
       Robocop too… but there it is more subtle as the main machines in
       that world are corporations still made out of humans.

       Indiana Jones and Marvel’s Daredevil S1 (Netflix)
       You know, for a comic book superhero show called Daredevil, there
       is a surprising lack of comic book stuff, superheroes and
       Daredevil. But there is a lot of TV show in it. But just like in
       the case with JJ, when the superheroy stuff shows up, the clash
       between realistic depiction of street level “vigilantes” and more
       goofy stuff can pull you out of the show. Thankfully, DD’s
       superheros stuff altogether makes like 2 minutes of the show at
       most.
       Writers pretty much utilize the same schtick as with JJ – realize
       who our protagonist is, what does he do, why does he do it,
       sprinkle it with yet another tie in to post-Avengers NYC and
       transform the show into crime drama / thriller; DD is, basically, a
       Jason Bourne TV show with a bigger focus on other characters and
       this time around rather colorful criminal organization, that is
       like polished version of any GTA’s syndicate. Healthy dose of
       newspaper commentary, legal system commentary, religion, law,
       order, consequences… you know the drill of a good show.
       Strengths: writing is fun, I haven’t seen a single joke that would
       fall flat, all storylines are pretty interesting, fight sequences
       are mostly superb (with one pants-shittingly AWESOME), R rating is
       used appropriately, acting is fine all around and thank fucking god
       that all the love stories are actually quite unique and don’t make
       me slit my wrists.
       Weaknesses: Wellp, except that superheroey stuff, the goddamn
       finale and one episode suffering from too much drama, this is
       pretty much as competent as it should have been.
       So yea… you know, if you have time, you can watch it. If you want
       to know more about post-Avengers NYC and how other people feel
       about it, you can watch it. It’s a blast. 8/10

       Well… to be fair (again), Tarzan was written to be epic.
       It IS after all by the guy who basically invented a Superman and a
       Conan and a couple a more archetypical ubermensch characters before
       they were actually invented.
       I mean… Tarzan teaches himself to read English from looking at
       pictures in children’s books – before he learned to speak English.
       Or human.
       Then he picks up French after he meets a Frenchman, then continues
       picking up languages, human and animal, and defeating practically
       every large animal in Africa in hand to paw combat.
       Then he goes inside the Hollow Earth and wrestles dinosaurs.

       This is another symptom of the progressing individualisation –
       watching movies in the cinema is a social experience that cannot
       exactly be replicated at home – this seems like another way of
       further atomizing people.
       I think I’m taking Nolan’s side on this.
       On the economic side of things it seems that the producers want to
       cut out the middle-men, i.e. the cinemas/theatres and cut down on
       distribution costs as it’s way cheaper to put the shit on a server
       and be done with the hassle. Plus, it really will cheapen the
       experience. I don’t go to cinemas often but even a 30+ inch screen
       and 7.1 surround can’t replicate a true cinema experience. But then
       again I mean a real cinema, not some shitty multiplex.

       This first one… well… Lucas kinda made it partially true by
       arbitrarily deciding to not wipe R2’s memory in the prequels.
       Meaning that R2 knows that Luke is drooling over his own sister
       when R2 shows him the hologram of her.
       Also, that makes R2 a dick here.
       Elsewhere too, but here it looks like he’s torturing a person with

     * Sully
       Do to it being superhero vs. superhero year, Collider is asking who
       would win in a fight; Batman or Captain America. It’s the dumbest
       fucking debate ever.
     * Doctor Andre Son of Thomas.
       The far more important debate is could the U.S.S Enterprise beat a
       Star Destroyer?
     * Cream-A-Thon
       In a battle between Adam West & Reb Brown, I’d go West.
     * Sully
       Kirk or Picard?
     * Cream-A-Thon
       Start a warp core breach in the Enterprise and eject into the path
       of the Star Destroyer. That’s how I’d do it.
     * Doctor Andre Son of Thomas.
       Kirk would beam over, seduce Captain Phasma and get her to disable
       the shields.
       Picard would get Gordie to find a harmonic resonance in the
       sheilds.
       either way they win.
     * Doctor Andre Son of Thomas.
       They eject those things so often, they cant be cheap.
       Admaral: “You ejected another 300 Trillion credit warp core! Do you
       have any idea what thats going to do to the budget!”
     * Sully
       There are so many factors. Star Destroyers have more fire power and
       can utilize that firepower at a faster pace, but are shit when it
       comes to maneuverability.
       The Enterprise, while slower in the return fire position, is
       capable of quicker maneuvering.
       The clench is, the Star Destroyer is full of TIE fighters.
     * Doctor Andre Son of Thomas.
       In a straight shooting fight the star destroyer wins every time.
       but the enterprise has plasma coils… there must be some way to use
       them.
     * Cream-A-Thon
       I could also see Picard enlisting the help of a few dozen Klingon
       Bird-of-Preys in this fight. Picard also has a flair for the
       dramatic reversal-of-fortune and likes catching over-confident
       antagonists at the height of their monologue with a simple “Now,
       Mr. Worf…”.
     * Doctor Andre Son of Thomas.
       I could watch Patrick Stewart and Andreas Katsulas trading clever
       remarks over the viewscreen for hours.
     * Cream-A-Thon
       Is there a difference between Star Destroyer and Bulk Cruiser or
       are they both “Star Destroyers” , just in different classes?
     * Sully
       There are videos of this fight already all over youtube. I’ve seen
       a couple but can’t recall who wins. It pretty much boils down to
       who wants who to win.
       Landis actually has an interesting video on his channel about
       online nerd “Versus Debates.” That said, and to get back on topic,
       it would take pure comic book PIS for Batman to beat Captain
       America in any way, shape, or form.
     * Cream-A-Thon
       Two words come to mind: ramming speed.
     * Sully
       Bulk Cruisers are the Rebel equivalent, aren’t they?
     * Sully
       Grand Moff isn’t really the monologue sort.
     * Cream-A-Thon
       I do not know, was always a bigger fan of Trek so those ships’s’s’s
       capabilities I know more about. I just remember Han Solo saying
       something about outrunning “the big Corellian ships” not “your
       local bulk cruiser”. I thought it might be significant but I’ll
       just shut up now.
     * Sully
       This is a Bulk Cruiser. Looks like something someone would use for
       space fisting a giant alien vagina.

       Will all of the preemptive bad press on B v S actually translate

     * Sheriff Mitchell
       I don’t know. Some certainly will, but I do wonder if a general
       audience having no real connection to this version of Batman will
       result in a lack of interest. I mean the film is a week away and
       I’m not really feeling the hype, for what that’s worth.
     * Earth
       We’ll see I guess. I’m a terrible judge of hype.
     * Sheriff Mitchell
       I don’t know that I’m any good at it, either. If it’s there, I
       haven’t really noticed. I’m just wondering if people will see it
       almost out of a sense of obligation. “This movie doesn’t look that
       good, but Batman is in it and ehhh there’s nothing else to do?”
       seems to be the motivation.

     * Hank_Henshaw
       Sorry if I ruined it for anyone.
     * Wizard Phoenix

       A comparison of Arrow and Daredevil:
       When there’s blood on Arrow-Oh, for a TV-14 that’s kinda bloody
       When there’s blood on Daredevil-HE GUTTED THE CARTEL GUYS AND HUNG
       THEM ON FUCKING MEAT HOOKS?! *vomits*
     * [699]mooggit
       Is Daredevil really that violent in the comics?
     * Wizard Phoenix
       No, it was violent as hell but the Punisher Max line was that
       violent.
     * [700]mooggit
       Would you say he’s acting out of character, then?
     * Wizard Phoenix
       No because Daredevil didn’t gut the Latino guys.
     * Earth
       Possibly. BatmanNews will see it. Most marvel fans who want to
       bitch about how much better Marvel is will probably see it too.
       General public? Who knows? These are the people who came out to see
       Transformers Dark Side of the Silver Surfer.
     * Sully
       Jesus Christ, Hank. Next thing you tell me is that Matt Murdock and
       DareDevil are the same guy.
     * Hank_Henshaw
       How come bat-a-rangs in movies never even vaguely resemble
       boomerangs? They should be called bat-shurikens, or bat-knifes, or
       whatever.
     * Wizard Phoenix
       Why does Green Arrow have a problem killing Merlyn even though he’s
       killed tons of people in the first season alone?
     * Sully
       Do they even call them “batarangs” in the Nolan films?
     * Hank_Henshaw
       The fucking batmobile was called Tumbler. Batarang is too silly for
       those movies.
     * Wizard Phoenix
       No. He doesn’t even name them. Where was his trusty Bat-Credit card
       in the Nolan films?
     * Sully
       He maxed it out modding the [DEL: Tumblr :DEL] [DEL: Tumbler :DEL]
       Batmobile.
     * Sully
       Because Merlyn has a contractual obligation to return for future
       seasons.
     * Sully
       “SUPERMAN IS CLARK KENT… FROM KANSAS!!”
       “Who?
       “CLARK! CLARK KENT! FROM KANSAS!! SMALLVILLE, KANSAS!!”
       “I thought his name was Kal-El. And isn’t he from the planet
       Krypton.”
       “SHUT UP, NERD!! NOBODY UNDERSTANDS YOUR NERD GIBBERISH!!”
     * Wizard Phoenix
       So I am watching Arrow Season 3, four episodes in, and I many
       questions. Get that Prometheus music ready!
       How come despite murdering tons of people before hand does Oliver
       have a problem killing Merlyn, a mass murderer? How does a boxing
       glove on an arrow work in this universe? Why does Roy look
       skinnier? Does he have AIDS? So, Thea despite being trained by
       Merlyn on how to fight still hasn’t figured out Oliver is the
       Arrow? Is Thea a retard? Why doesn’t Oliver let Not Talia take or
       kill Merlyn? How is it that Ra’s al Ghul just looks like a normal
       white guy they picked off the street? Why would you let loose a guy
       wanting to go home in Hong Kong to train to be a spy? Are they
       stupid? How come Felicity’s mother doesn’t look like her? Why would
       her ex boyfriend hold some kind of grudge against her? Doesn’t he
       know people naturally change? Why would the NSA hire this nutball?
       Where did he get his army? Why doesn’t Diggle wear another outfit
       while helping out Oliver and Roy stop the villain of the week? Does
       he want his daughter to be killed?
     * Sully
       Voice altering technology is the glasses of the Arrow universe.
       “I can totally see your face right now, but the voice… the voice is
       different. Oh well, *laughing* I guess you’re not Oliver Queen. And
       the fact that you hang out with a black guy, just like Oliver does,
       also means nothing. Diggle? Is that you?”
       The better question is; DareDevil season 2 is on Netflix. Why are
       you watching Arrow… any season?
     * Palpatine
       Well he did write Jurassic Park, Mission: Impossible, and Sam
       Rami’s Spiderman, and those were good. But then again also wrote
       The Lost World and Kingdom of the Crystal Skull, so there’s that.
     * Thanatos2k
       You mean cow prod
     * OMNI
       Indiana Jones and the Temple of the Dog: A world going hungry…
     * Thanatos2k
       I hope you two are not somehow obligated to see every Max Landis
       movie now.
     * Sully
       Not in Korea.
     * OMNI
       At least it’s not Temple of the Fox….
     * Holly
       They sold out. Mike just said nice things about Max Landis because
       Max Landis is friendly and likes them and might be able to help
       them get investor money from hollywood and after they all watched
       that bad movie together they had a sleep over in which Mike fell
       asleep and Max blew him. Mike knew he was being blown but pretended
       to be asleep and Max knew that he was really awake. The two
       remained silent during the encounter and never spoke of this event
       but it was understood that they would give him a good review for
       what occurred during the sleepover.
       That is why they did not rip his movie and they sold out.
       The Hack frauds sold us out for a blow job from a terrible writer.
       Also jay did not get blown because he is the sidekick and is
       quieter and is the homemaker in the relationship.
     * NilbogResident
       Oh god, I heard about the new Indiana Jones film.
     * Sully
       You wouldn’t DARE!
     * OMNI
       Eddie Vetter and Chris Cornell rumored to write
     * [701]Captain Prickhard
       RLM is screwed. No doubt they’ve already deleted the HitB Hulk
       Hogan sex tape review episode.
     * OMNI
       What does the Fox say…?
     * NilbogResident
       I think Layne Staley could write a better script than the last one.
     * OMNI
       Yes but he’s booked at the Great gig in the sky.
     * NilbogResident
       As I said…
     * NilbogResident
       I’m wondering if he wrote Crystal Skull at gunpoint.
     * Hank_Henshaw
       Darabont’s Indy 4 script had a lot of ridiculous elements to it
       too, a lot of which are present in Crystal Skull. It’s clear George
       had a very specific idea for the movie in mind, set pieces he
       wanted to see in it, and allowed the screenwriters to write the
       dialogue and connective tissue.
     * Sully
       “Eat a dick?”
     * NilbogResident
       Interesting. Speilberg definitely had an “oh, what the hell”
       attitude when talking about it. Like when a good friend wants you
       to do something bad.
     * Captain Turbo
       I’m waiting for the Rich Evans sex tape. Hubba hubba…

       Okay, back to Star Trek; I watched Frame of Mind last night. THAT
       is a perfect example of science fiction. I know, I know; the show’s
       over 20 year’s old, almost thirty. Who cares, right? That episode
       had me second guessing and made me feel REAL EMOTIONS! It’s so
       good; William Riker is not only a rapist, but a good actor to boot.

       Daredevil Season Two Episode 3, holy shit what a great episode. It
       was 75% dialogue it worked because of the dialogue itself and the
       characters being great. Then the other 25% is a highly complex one
       shot high scene that’s worthy of The Revenant.

       Is Mike developing Altzheimers? That shaky right arm of his was

       Clown Cried”?! The unreleased Jerry Lewis film where he plays a
       clown that leads kids into the gas chamber of a concentration camp.
     * Malevolence
       10 Cloverfield Lane, though the name being a marketing gimmick,
       still shows that John Goodman is an amazing actor. Though it’s sad
       to see that he regained the weight, he still showed his prowess,
       with his ability to be both extremely endearing and extremely
       imposing with the same character.

       Alzheimer’s destroys your memory and cognitive functions. You’re

     * dennett316
       10 Cloverfield Lane was great, and I agree, that ending sequence
       wasn’t really needed. They could’ve done it less actiony…but it
       didn’t ruin the movie that came before it.
       I want these guys to review The Boy, because holy shit, that’s some
       funny stuff in that movie. The possibility of a goofy haunted doll
       is the most credible part of the movie. The “twist” they went
       with….it’s a doozy. The audience I was watching it with were
       laughing their asses off. It almost became a good comedy.
     * spacecarp
       Nah… 10 Cloverfield Lane would have made an okay movie of the week
       for television but as a feature film (that I mistakenly paid to
       watch in the cinema!) it was pretty boring.
     * [710]Imperator Furryosa
       Oh good, I’m usually right there with Jay on opinions, but when
       Mike pointed out the discordance between the opening of Chasing Amy
       and the rest of the movie, I was right where I belonged.

       When I looked at the draft of 6455 dollars, I have faith that
       brother of my friend was like really generating cash in his free
       time with his PC..mw His aunt’s neighbor has done this for only 11
       months and by now repaid the loan on their home and bought a new
       Car.

       Do you actually want to be explained? It seems like you weren’t
       paying attention to the movie.
       The hatch that he usually uses to reach the air filtration system
       was blocked due to something falling over onto or being lodged into
       the hatch. He literally explains this out loud.
     * CapedBaldy
       Think harder and try again chum. WHY was it designed to be so far
       away? Hatch makes no sense. It should be designed so you can access
       it EASILY from the inside – outside hatch or not.
