In this directory is thecomplete listing of mementos for all 1000 links (finalMementoList.txt)

Also included are the preceding chunks of the original 1000 links (Linksaa through Linkssae).

These chunks made running "getMementos.py" easier and more manageable because I didn't
have to run all 1000 links all at once and risk a mistake or error taking all of the work with it.

Once run using the command "python getMementos.py Links__ > Links__.txt" the associated five text files were produced.

Then those five text files were combined using the "cat" command into "finalMementoList.txt"
