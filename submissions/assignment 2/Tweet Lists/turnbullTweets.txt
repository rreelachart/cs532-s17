826042433502732288:"Oh yeah this horse farmer character probably does not make as many bird analogies as I, 20-year-veteran-of-bird-ownership do"
826041616989188097:Sometimes it's hard to remember your characters don't necessarily know things you know. I'm always axing conversations about bird trivia.
826041139132116992:It wasn't like, A Thing that this guy was secretly moved by Canadian Wilderness in the book, the author just forgot the dude's voice briefly
826040651435216896:like, it started in this purple-prosey scene of language they had never used about how moved they were by the beauty of nature
826040344806510592:I remember reading a character who was supposed to be a dull, stoic soldier who suddenly out of the blue started waxing poetic about hills.
826039970842365952:More on this subject, in a 3rd person narrative you need to be mindful of what you, the author notices VS what your character would notice

826017371462590468:@kellhound @heysawbones but if not it's such a huge wanky writer slip-up
826017218416697344:@kellhound @heysawbones it's such an interesting piece of writing to me, b/c if he wanted the character to sound like a twit it's brilliant-
826011161116057602:@kellhound ha ha wooooow.
826006426761908224:@heysawbones This was the point where I figured it was obviously going to turn into a vampire story. https://t.co/apdADRuKho
826004415072972801:@heysawbones so who knows maybe it was on purpose
826004283266994176:@heysawbones It's funny because the character seemed so self obsessed and insufferable I correctly guessed the twist was they were a vampire
826003718625644544:@MotorcycleUS then you're using the literary tool to your advantage ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
826003336197332992:@kungfuman316 The scene where everyone freezs to watch her change, it's like... come on she looks like half the people in any SoCal gym
826002833828827138:@kungfuman316 but the movie wanted SO BAD to convince us she was so they kept doing just that with the camera.
826002647748534272:@kungfuman316 I don't think she's an unattractive person or anything, but she's not like, the kind of person you stop and stare at.
826002057274404865:@kungfuman316 I felt this way about Harley in Suicide Squad, Robbie did a great job but the staging was so "GET IT?! SHE'S HOT!! YA GET IT?"
826001508877561857:@MarvalAlice It's all about knowing how to use the tools at your disposal.
826001339465359360:@MarvalAlice Not necessarily if you're actively trying to make the character seem like a self absorbed twit.
826000138648768513:It makes your character seem so monumentally self absorbed to talk about the "blood red lipstick rings" they leave on their own cigarette.
825999287859294210:But if a character is waxing poetic about themselves it looks like they're just smoking a cigarette and thinking about how hot they are
825998903283552257:If a character is infatuated with another person, they might describe them meticulous detail, intrigued by everything they do.
825998255741808640:But in a first person perspective story, you're describing what your character is the most engaged with in a situation.
825997801158963200:So in a 3rd person perspective story, you're describing what your audience member is supposedly having their attention most attracted by
825997367061082112:in writing, the things being described in the most detail are the "focal point" of the subject, or what the proverbial camera is looking at.
825996915732992005:But relevant to this subject, they talk about keeping the focal point on Furiosa's nose. Cinematic version of saying her eyes are up here.
825996538723774464:The Centre Frame video about Mad Max goes into this "audience eye" idea a bit https://t.co/gYLIjQrlMX
825995892457033728:Focusing on certain angles is like the visual version of saying "and then the audience got distracted by her butt and stopped listening"
825995281732759552:A lot of what people are talking about when they say characters are being "objectified" aren't wardrobe choices as much as camera choices
825995013171531778:So the idea is, the camera represents how a viewer sees a scene, you want it to move &amp; focus in natural ways people would look at something
825994659465830400:I think it sort of ties into the literary version of the whole "camera is the viewer's eye" thing in cinematography and film making.

813988970417659904:But I guess that's a good sign that at the end of the movie I wanted to see more of the characters and what happened to them hahaha
813988706646302720:One thing I will say, though, it felt like it needed little epilogue interstitials in the credits, the story was MADE for that kind of thing
813988394636189696:It was exactly what it said on the box, but it executed what it was well.
813988182672838656:None of them were especially deep or involved, but it was a solid collection of well-executed, simple storylines.
813987815897767936:But they did a good job layering all the stories in such a way that they all felt like they had a substantial arc.
813987545981665280:The issue a lot of (usually animated) films have is adding so many characters none of them get enough screen time to tell a satisfying story

811449548459511808:@beesmygod but it's like people I know who like the star war prequels more than the originals, it gave them a big world to RP in.
811449215750549504:@beesmygod personally Tolkien doesn't do it for me because his writing it all about adding every cool thing and wizard-did-it-ing plotholes
811448852486066178:@beesmygod like, if I talk to my dad about Tolkien stuff, all the stuff that makes him love it is worldbuilding he extrapolated out of it.
811448633111392256:@beesmygod I mean, I think it's about what you go into the books for. People who want immersion usually really enjoy that kind of thing.
811448065403932673:@beesmygod 'cause if you tell the audience they're wrong after they've warmed up to their own interpretation they'll never forgive you.
811447717067005952:@beesmygod the deal with the devil is that you can't fill in those gaps later without completely jerking the readers out of the world
811447235099508736:@beesmygod similar to LotR/Zelda/etc, you put a playset of worldbuilding on the table and let your audience write the story they want to see
811446888134098944:@beesmygod as an aside, this approach to writing is an extremely effective way to engage audiences and create diehard fans.
