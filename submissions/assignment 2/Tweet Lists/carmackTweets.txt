826531007381794817:Jan Paul van Waveren passed away today. The best developer I ever worked with, my right hand, and a good friend. It was an honor.
826476672920801280:@molecularmusing @LiaSae I keep arguing for rigorously defining GPU texture layouts, at least as an option with possible perf implications.
826469505249529856:@molecularmusing @rygorous @SebAaltonen @mmalex @snemarch @LiaSae I still think that is a good model for modern dev!
826460175091585025:@CashMashXXL No, I haven't.
826157918877777920:@JimCrackton with only virgin credibly working towards suborbital tourism, and it largely being image for them, going slow became natural
826147162065076224:@JimCrackton I didn't think it would be as fast as some were predicting, but 20 years is longer than I expected
825905135704498176:@nothings @pervognsen did you consider paying for "real" professional tools? No idea if they are actually better...
825878729121492992:@nothings @pervognsen I have to fight the urge to do retro projects on systems I wasn't originally exposed to
825835828387729408:@pervognsen I had hacking/phreaking files from BBS, but never any good "real" programming info
825835445493829633:@pervognsen no, I didn't. Hard for people today to appreciate how scarce info was back then; Foley&amp;Van Damn was no help for low level hacks

825721199875461121:@paniq @pervognsen yeah, but that sort of demo scene work generally translated poorly to the game development process
825719202946416642:@pervognsen I wonder if decent general compression of the map data could have worked out better. Compression wasn't broadly understood then.

825354292735393792:@lbljeffmo I agree, my point is that the entire topic is so filled with minefields that it doesn't get honestly and forthrightly debated.
825353149095481345:@lbljeffmo someone in replies just made the zero filter argument...
825352723893731329:@FARTRON That can be a defensible position only if you are willing to drastically reduce per-capita government services. If so, ok!
825346783761022977:@FARTRON You would allow anyone in the world to immigrate without question? Really? That is a very hard position to defend.
825344933817098240:Any kind of an immigration filter other than a dice roll is literally discrimination. There are many options. Discriminate wisely.

820104022506045441:@JBrooksBSI I think the pipeline stages on 6502 have more gate delays than a modern high GHZ CPU, so it should clock slower. Not sure.

819872329475964928:@BruceHoult @pervognsen of course; I wasn't suggesting it was an optimal win. Wasn't ARM 1 more like 8x the transistors?
819865971712229376:@pervognsen @nothings programming for ROM-heavy systems probably incentivized better programming style -- everything doesn't become state.

775802710922625025:Android blends multiple image layers for the screen,worst case is huge images shrunk down (undersampled), bilinear fitlering can be 4x worse
775724243795398656:@FioraAeterna @ssylvan Holy shit! That sounds dangerous to the hardware.
775723576208916480:@FioraAeterna @ssylvan I had a four-core CPU workload that throttled in 60 sec with nothing else going on, should be easy to go way worse.
775723330078842881:@FioraAeterna @ssylvan I often consider that -- peg CPUs, GPU, camera, ISP, CODEC, WiFi, GPS, DSP. I assume a could hit thermal in 10 sec.

775718978492608512:@FioraAeterna By overheating, I meant "not able to run at steady state". If DVFS drops ram clock the display would fail ugly.
775718078906642433:@FioraAeterna No idea what the cache granularity is.  Would be interesting to see the failure behavior on saturating memory bandwidth.
775717893195444224:@FioraAeterna You could arrange a single bilinear read to be four cache lines, so 16 lines of mem bandwidth x 2560x1440 pixels x 60 hz.
775714620707221505:I wonder if you could overheat a phone by just abusing the display hardware composer with a maximum count of bilinear undersampled layers.

772460183175909376:@FioraAeterna @Jonathan_Blow Ouch. I'm alternate-history-ing here, not making an actual engineering suggestion. :-)
772458410700791808:@Jonathan_Blow @FioraAeterna and the fact that performance on PC is, for many applications (not VR!) "solved", trades get different values.
772457125352054784:@FioraAeterna That is the meta-point -- perhaps the fast-and-loose GPU dev model isn't optimal. Again, I suspect it is, but not 100% sure.
772456735453749252:@FioraAeterna Hopefully you start with something that doesn't completely suck, and you document thoroughly.
772456370427666434:@FioraAeterna like x86, which turned out better than almost everyone expected
772456248423780353:@FioraAeterna no driver at all -- essentially a compatible console with increasing perf by micro arch and process
772455933343510532:@FioraAeterna removing the opportunity to change things in the API driver constrains the IHV development model, possibly to consumer benefit
772455620309979139:@FioraAeterna just like there are no x86 driver bugs -- a chip that doesn't work doesn't ship (mostly).
772455413182664705:@FioraAeterna I do think the right choice was made, but I don't think it is a complete slam-dunk, and it may need to be reevaluated sometime
772455241300140033:@FioraAeterna peak performance would surely have suffered, but having no driver bugs could be a net typical user quality win.
772454422186070016:@Ilseman for the win, it would have to be a full system architecture, not just the code -- threading model / dispatch, memory access, etc.
772454150944665600:I guessed that AMDs console wins and architectural openness would have advantaged them on PC the last few years. Any objective evidence?
772453247478927360:\ development could have looked like if it was a backwards compatible hardware architecture instead of an API compatible driver world.
