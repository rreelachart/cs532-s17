This directory holds the collection of URIs gathered from the collection of Tweets in the "Tweet Lists" directory.

These lists were made by running "python getURIFromTweets.py <filename> > <filename>"

All URI collections share a similar name to the tweet collections from which they were created*.

*The one exception is "gunURIs.txt" which has a typo in the name. It is associated with "gunnTweets.txt"
